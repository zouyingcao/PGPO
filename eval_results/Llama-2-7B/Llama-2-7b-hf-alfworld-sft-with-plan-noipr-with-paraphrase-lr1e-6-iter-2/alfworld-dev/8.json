You should first think about the current condition and plan for your future actions, and then output your action in this turn. Your output must strictly follow this format:\"Thought: your thoughts.\\nAction: your next action\".\n\nThe available actions are:\n1. go to {recep}\n2. take {obj} from {recep}\n3. put {obj} in/on {recep}\n4. open {recep}\n5. close {recep}\n6. toggle {obj} {recep}\n7. clean {obj} with {recep}\n8. heat {obj} with {recep}\n9. cool {obj} with {recep}\nwhere {obj} and {recep} correspond to objects and receptacles.\nAfter your each turn, the environment will give you immediate feedback based on which you plan your next few steps. if the envrionment output \"Nothing happened\", that means the previous action is invalid and you should try more options.\n\nYour response should use the following format:\n\nThought: <your thoughts>\nAction: <your next action>"
