class Environment:
    r""" Class allowing to interact with the game's interpreter.

    The role of an `Environment` is to handle the communication between user
    code and the backend interpreter that manages the text-based game. The
    overall `Environment` structure is highly inspired by `OpenAI's gym
    <https://github.com/openai/gym>`_.

    Example
    -------
    Here's a minimal example of how to interact with an `Environment`

    >>> import textworld
    >>> options = textworld.GameOptions()
    >>> options.seeds = 1234
    >>> options.nb_objects = 5
    >>> options.quest_length = 2
    >>> game_file, _ = textworld.make(options, path='./')  # Generate a random game.
    >>> env = textworld.start(game_file)  # Load the game.
    >>> game_state = env.reset()  # Start a new game.
    >>> env.render()
    I hope you're ready to go into rooms and interact with objects, because you've
    just entered TextWorld! Here is how to play! First thing I need you to do is to
    ensure that the type G chest is open. And then, pick up the keycard from the
    type G chest inside the attic. Got that? Good!
    <BLANKLINE>
    -= Attic =-
    You arrive in an attic. A normal kind of place. You begin to take stock of
    what's in the room.
    <BLANKLINE>
    You make out a type G chest. You can see a TextWorld style locker. The TextWorld
    style locker contains a frisbee and a sock.
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    There is a TextWorld style key on the floor.
    >>> command = "take key"  # Command to send to the game.
    >>> game_state, reward, done = env.step(command)
    >>> env.render()
    (the TextWorld style key)
    You pick up the TextWorld style key from the ground.
