<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.3. Pattern matching</p>
<p>In this section, let's make the following new phrase:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c738" -->
<a id="c738"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To admire (item - an object):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You take a long look at [item].&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This does very little, of course, but it does allow the wording to be different each time the phrase is used:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c739" -->
<a id="c739"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
admire the diamonds;
<br />admire Mr Cogito;
<br />admire the honey sandwich;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and our single definition covers all of these possibilities. The bracketed part of the definition, &quot;(item - an object)&quot;, tells Inform to expect an object in that position, and Inform enforces this carefully. So this definition might tell Inform what &quot;admire the barricade&quot; means, but not what</p>
<!-- START CODE "c740" -->
<a id="c740"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
admire &quot;blue cheese&quot;;
<br />admire 63;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>mean. Unless some other definition sorts the matter out, Inform will reply to uses like this with a Problem message:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c741" -->
<a id="c741"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<span class="boldface">Problem.</span> You wrote 'admire 63' <img alt="Reveal.png" src="Documentation/Images/Reveal.png" />, but '63' has the wrong kind of value: a number rather than an object.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The object does not need to be named literally, but can be anything which works out to be an object: for instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c742" -->
<a id="c742"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After dropping something in the Auction House:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;admire the noun.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which Inform allows because &quot;noun&quot;, here, is a name for the object which is being acted on.</p>
<p>Inform decides which definition to apply in a process called &quot;pattern matching&quot;.</p>
<p>The bracketed part of the example definition has the form &quot;(name - kind)&quot;. The definition only applies if the text supplied agrees with the &quot;kind&quot; part - for instance, the diamonds agreed with &quot;object&quot;, but 63 did not. If the definition  does apply, then the Inform works through the rest of the phrase using &quot;name&quot; to mean whatever value matched. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c743" -->
<a id="c743"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To slam shut (box - an open container):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;With great panache, you slam shut [the box].&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the box is closed.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When this phrase is followed, &quot;box&quot; means whatever open container the pattern-matcher found when it was called for. For example, if Inform reads</p>
<!-- START CODE "c744" -->
<a id="c744"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
slam shut the Dutch armoire;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then it acts on this by following the definition of &quot;slam shut ...&quot;, using the Dutch armoire object as the value of &quot;box&quot;, so it prints:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c745" -->
<a id="c745"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
With great panache, you slam shut the Dutch armoire.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and renders it closed.</p>
<p>In fact any description can be given in the definition, and that includes a single, specific value. For instance, we could define:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c746" -->
<a id="c746"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To grant (bonus - a number) points:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;increase the score by the bonus.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c747" -->
<a id="c747"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To grant (bonus - 7) points:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You shiver uncontrollably.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which would withhold this unlucky bounty. That would mean that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c748" -->
<a id="c748"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
grant 7 points;
<br />grant seven points;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>would each produce uncontrollable shivers, because Inform uses the definition applying to the number 7; but</p>
<!-- START CODE "c749" -->
<a id="c749"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
grant six points;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>would increase the score by 6. In general Inform always follows the principle that more specific definitions take priority over more general ones. So although the definitions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c750" -->
<a id="c750"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To grant (bonus - a number) points: ...
<br />To grant (bonus - 7) points: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>both apply to the case of &quot;grant 7 points&quot;, Inform uses the second, because it's the more specific of the two possibilities.</p>
<p>Sometimes it will not be possible to tell if the value supplied meets the requirements until the story is actually playing. If, at run-time, no definition fits some phrase which has to be carried out, a run-time problem message is produced.</p>
<p>Finally, and more straightforwardly, we can specify variations in wording using slashes between alternative words in a &quot;To ...&quot; definition. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c751" -->
<a id="c751"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To grant (bonus - a number) point/points: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>allows the final word to be either &quot;point&quot; or &quot;points&quot;. Slashes like this can only be used with literal words, not bracketed values, and give alternative forms only of a single word at a time; the alternative &quot;--&quot; means &quot;no word at all&quot;, and thus makes it optional:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c752" -->
<a id="c752"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To grant (bonus - a number) point/points/--: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>makes &quot;grant 3&quot; do the same as &quot;grant 3 points&quot;.</p>
<p>If we need more variation than that, we should make more than one definition.</p>
