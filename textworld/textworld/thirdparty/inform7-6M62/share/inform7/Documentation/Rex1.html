<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:</p>

<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <span class="boldface">Control Center</span> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.</p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether it is switched on or off. In <span class="boldface">Model Shop</span> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.</p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <span class="boldface">Signs and Portents</span>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.</p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <span class="boldface">What Makes You Tick</span> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.</p>

<p>It may be that we want (as an added nuance) to add other names for these items.

We could define these additional names like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23776" -->

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In the second case, we are defining [train] to mean any of the three phrases &quot;train&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, and &quot;model train&quot;; so &quot;[train] button&quot; will match &quot;model train button&quot; or &quot;train button&quot; or &quot;model button&quot; equally well.

<p>And now the game will have a model train's button and a toy elephant's button.</p>
<p>It may be that we want (as an added nuance) to add other names for these items. While we would want an assembly to create objects such as &quot;Lucy's hand&quot; and not &quot;Lucy hand&quot;, it is entirely reasonable to want to talk about the model train button or the elephant button. We could define these additional names like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23789" -->
<a id="c23789"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;elephant button&quot; or &quot;button on elephant&quot; as the elephant's button.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23790" -->
<a id="c23790"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;model train&quot; or &quot;model&quot; or &quot;train&quot; as &quot;[train]&quot;. Understand &quot;[train] button&quot; or  &quot;button on [train]&quot; as the model train's button.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In the second case, we are defining [train] to mean any of the three phrases &quot;train&quot;, &quot;model&quot;, and &quot;model train&quot;; so &quot;[train] button&quot; will match &quot;model train button&quot; or &quot;train button&quot; or &quot;model button&quot; equally well. See the chapter on Understanding for more on how to create alternative phrasings for the player to use.</p>
