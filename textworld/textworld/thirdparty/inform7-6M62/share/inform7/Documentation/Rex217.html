<p>The simplest form of clock is a wrist watch. Here is a choice of analogue or digital:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Better clocks would allow us also to set the time, and to stop and start them: see <span class="boldface">Tom's Midnight Garden</span>.</p>
<p>Scientific instruments provide sharper versions of our own senses. In the case of vision, they allow us to see closer up, or further away. It's a convention of IF that people can normally see only the current location, that is, they cannot see from one location into another. The boundary of the current room is like a horizon, even out of doors (though it's true that there are ways to disguise that with a continuous outdoor landscape). <span class="boldface">Ginger Beer</span> provides a telescope able to see into other rooms.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Witnessed 2</span> provides a meter which measures how close a ghost is to the player.</p>
