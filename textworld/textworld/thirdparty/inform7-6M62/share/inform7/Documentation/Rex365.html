<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.3. Reactive Characters</p>
<p>As we observe characters, so they observe us. Those who seem to have no awareness of what the player is doing often come across more like waxworks than like people. <span class="boldface">Zodiac</span> demonstrates a scenario where the watchful presence of a dangerous criminal keeps the player from doing what he otherwise might, while <span class="boldface">Police State</span> expands on this idea with a policeman who reacts to entire types of behavior in his presence, regardless of whether the culprit is the player or a third party. <span class="boldface">Noisemaking</span> has a crow who will fly away in response to any loud noises the player makes.</p>
<p>And, of course, we definitely want to have characters react to being looked at or otherwise interfered with. <span class="boldface">Search and Seizure</span> implements a smuggler who reacts when we try to confiscate his possessions. <span class="boldface">Pine 1</span> gives us a sleeping princess who can be woken by a variety of methods.</p>
<p>We wrap up this section with two complete puzzle scenarios that demonstrate what can be achieved by giving characters reactions to the player's behavior. <span class="boldface">A Day For Fresh Sushi</span> has a fish who watches the player's actions and comments on them, while the live furnishings in <span class="boldface">Revenge of the Fussy Table</span> instead comment every turn on the current state of the world, until the player has successfully sorted out all their complaints.</p>

<p>This example does include a number of features that we haven't met yet, particularly rulebooks. Nonetheless, the basic idea should be relatively clear. Our premise is that the player is faced with a series of disgruntled furnishings, none of which want to be responsible for supporting the cold, hot, drippy, or spiky objects lying around the room.</p>
