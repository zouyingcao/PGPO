<p>The kind &quot;container&quot; allows one thing to contain others. Things are sometimes containers automatically, sometimes by instruction:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23720" -->
<a id="c23720"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The match is in the matchbox. The bucket is a container.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The matchbox, like the bucket, is a container. Containers come in all sizes and have a variety of behaviours, mainly controlled by the properties we give them: they can be &quot;open&quot; or &quot;closed&quot;, &quot;opaque&quot; or &quot;transparent&quot; (when closed), &quot;openable&quot; or not, &quot;lockable&quot; or not, &quot;enterable&quot; or not. The basic ideas of containment are to do with carrying and sometimes hiding the contents, and Inform makes this easy. Allowing for locking and unlocking is again straightforward:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23721" -->
<a id="c23721"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The strongbox is a locked container. The little steel key unlocks the strongbox.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Two built-in extensions enhance and modify the behavior of locks and keys: Locksmith automates a number of steps, automatically unlocking doors when trying to open them (for instance). Skeleton Keys allows us to define multiple keys that unlock the same object, rather than being restricted to one matching key per item.</p>
<p>For a container with a combination lock, rather than a key, see <span class="boldface">Safety</span>; for a more sophisticated safe requiring digits dialed over multiple turns, see <span class="boldface">Eyes, Fingers, Toes</span>.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Trachypachidae Maturin 1803</span> provides a bottle that is stoppered with a cork: when it is closed, the cork is part of the bottle, but otherwise the cork becomes a separate object we can carry around.</p>
<p>The normal assumption is that there is no problem with any two portable items being carried together, but in reality they may affect each other. (For effects like magnetism, or getting each other wet, or setting each other on fire, see the Physics chapter.) Here is a cat which, if boxed up with one or more items of food, will eat something each turn until all is gone:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23722" -->
<a id="c23722"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries a wicker basket and a scarlet fish. The cat is an animal in the wicker basket. The fish is edible.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23723" -->
<a id="c23723"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn when the cat is in a container (called the bag) and something edible (called the foodstuff) is in the bag:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;remove the foodstuff from play;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;With mingled sounds of mewing and chomping, the cat nibbles up [the foodstuff].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The examples below provide subtler effects, adapting text to the current situation. In <span class="boldface">Cinco</span>, the container's name changes depending on what it contains: putting beef in a taco allows the player to call it a SHREDDED BEEF TACO. In <span class="boldface">Unpeeled</span> and <span class="boldface">Shipping Trunk</span>, the description of something inside a container changes according to other things are alongside it. This is taken further in <span class="boldface">Hudsucker Industries</span>, which describes the contents of a container as a group.</p>
<p>Finally, any action that destroys a container has to consider what to do with the things inside. <span class="boldface">Fallout Enclosure</span> demonstrates a zapping action that destroys cash registers and shelves but leaves their contents tidily behind.</p>

<p>In this scenario, the player starts with a bag full of unsorted letters. These can be polite or rude, but he won't know which until he has examined them. What's more, he is allowed to sort the letters, in which case a group of letters will be shown as (for instance) &quot;two polite letters&quot;; but a group of mixed letters, even if they have all been read, will be called &quot;unsorted letters&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, the player should be allowed to refer to sorted letters by tone, but not unsorted letters.</p>
<p>To do this, we'll need printing the name... and printing the plural name..., as well as some special understanding rules.</p>

<p>Now, there's a good bit of interaction to streamline. We intend that the player will be taking letters from the satchel, reading them, and putting them (perhaps grouped) into boxes.

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;it is very likely.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The rules about taking are more subtle: the player is more likely to want to take an ungrouped letter than a grouped one; he is more likely to want one from the satchel than not; and he is most unlikely to want to take a letter (grouped or ungrouped) that he is already holding.</p>
