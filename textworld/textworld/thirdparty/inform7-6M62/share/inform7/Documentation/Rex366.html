<p>Suppose we want to blur the boundaries between rooms, in an environment where there are no walls: out of doors, for instance?</p>
<p>The simplest cases involve making something exceptional visible in more than one place. <span class="boldface">Carnivale</span> features an exceptionally large landmark seen by day; <span class="boldface">Eddystone</span> an exceptionally bright one by night. <span class="boldface">Waterworld</span> allows a very distant object (the Sun) to be seen throughout many rooms, but never approached. <span class="boldface">View of Green Hills</span> gives the player an explicit command for looking through into an adjacent room.</p>
<p>Three systematic examples then present outdoor landscapes with increasing sophistication. <span class="boldface">Tiny Garden</span> gives the multiple rooms of an extended lawn descriptions which automatically adapt to say which directions lead into further lawn area. <span class="boldface">Rock Garden</span> provides a relation, &quot;connected with&quot;, between rooms, allowing items in one to be seen from the other: an attempt to interact with a visible item in a different area of the garden triggers an implicit going action first. <span class="boldface">Stately Gardens</span> provides a much larger outdoor area, where larger landmarks are visible from further away, and room descriptions are highly adaptive.</p>
<p>In an outdoor environment, the distinction between a one-move journey and a multiple-move journey is also blurred. <span class="boldface">Hotel Stechelberg</span> shows a signpost which treats these equally.</p>
