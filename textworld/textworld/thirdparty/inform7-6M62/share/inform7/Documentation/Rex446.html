<p>What should fit into what? Inform has basically three sizes: small, person-sized, and room-sized. The difference between &quot;small&quot; and &quot;person-sized&quot; doesn't appear much, but it's the difference between an ordinary container and an enterable container; the fact that a person cannot get inside an ordinary container is one of the few size-related rules built into Inform. It will not object to, say, a fishing rod being put inside a matchbox.</p>
<p>Inform does have one built-in measure of the size of a container: its &quot;carrying capacity&quot;. This is a maximum number of contents:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23735" -->
<a id="c23735"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The carrying capacity of the rucksack is 3.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This of course allows three anvils, while forbidding four postage stamps. To do better, we need units of measurement, and <span class="boldface">Dimensions</span> demonstrates setting these up. <span class="boldface">The Speed of Thought</span>, meanwhile, ventures into the area of unit conversion: having multiple types of unit and being able to express them to the player, or parse these in the player's input.</p>
<p>To be fully realistic in what will fit into what, we need sophisticated three-dimensional models of shapes, both of the items being carried and of the free space remaining inside containers. <span class="boldface">Depth</span> elegantly simplifies this by approximating items as cuboids, with a given width, length and height: these multiply to give a volume. To fit in a container, a new item's volume must not exceed the volume remaining inside the container, and in addition its three dimensions must also fit in one of the possible arrangements at right angles to the sides. (So this system would indeed prevent a 1x1x100 fishing rod from being put inside a 5x2x1 matchbox, but would also prevent a 12x1x1 pencil from being put into a 10x10x1 box, because it would need to be turned diagonally to fit.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Lead Cuts Paper</span> provides a different constraint: here we do not let light-weight containers hold heavy objects.</p>
<p>Weight comes in a different way into <span class="boldface">Swerve left? Swerve right? Or think about it and die?</span>, which exploits up/down map connections to work out which way gravity would take a rolling marble.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a number of objects in the game that are sized in some conventional unit (such as meters), but which we would like to describe in slightly less formal terms. To do this, we will start with measurements as defined in the built-in extension Metric Units, so we don't have to recreate all these.</p>
<p>We'll add our own set of &quot;conceptual units&quot; -- things we're familiar with in real life. As we'll see below, Inform will automatically choose a unit of the right order to express a given distance if we tell it to print a length &quot;in conceptual units&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: the following will compile only if you have settings set for Glulx. (To change this, go to the Settings panel and click on the Glulx option.) The Glulx virtual machine is capable of handling larger numbers than the Z-machine.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a number of objects in the game that are sized in some conventional unit (such as meters), but which we would like to describe in slightly less formal terms. To do this, we will start with measurements as defined in the built-in extension Metric Units, so we don't have to recreate all these.</p>
<p>We'll add our own set of &quot;conceptual units&quot; -- things we're familiar with in real life. As we'll see below, Inform will automatically choose a unit of the right order to express a given distance if we tell it to print a length &quot;in conceptual units&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: the following will compile only if you have settings set for Glulx. (To change this, go to the Settings panel and click on the Glulx option.) The Glulx virtual machine is capable of handling larger numbers than the Z-machine.</p>
