<p class="sectionheading">ยง13.10. Defining new prepositions</p>
<p>The term preposition is used here, a little loosely, to mean anything which we add to the verb <span class="italic">to be</span> in order to talk about some relation or other. We have seen many examples already, such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c970" -->
<a id="c970"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To be in - The ball is in the box.
<br />To be part of - The lever is part of the slot machine.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These are defined just the way verbs are. Compare the following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c971" -->
<a id="c971"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Suspicion relates various people to one person.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c972" -->
<a id="c972"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to suspect means the suspicion relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c973" -->
<a id="c973"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to be suspicious of means the suspicion relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The result of this is that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c974" -->
<a id="c974"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Hercule Poirot suspects Colonel Hotchkiss.
<br />Hercule Poirot is suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are exactly equivalent, and so are these two descriptions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c975" -->
<a id="c975"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
somebody who suspects Colonel Hotchkiss
<br />somebody suspicious of Colonel Hotchkiss
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>While most prepositions are short (&quot;in&quot;, &quot;part of&quot;, &quot;suspicious of&quot;), they're free to be longer if need be (&quot;inordinately far away from&quot;): the limit is 30 words, which should be ample.</p>
<p>We can also define verbs as auxiliaries, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c976" -->
<a id="c976"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to be able to approach means the approachability relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we can ask if Poirot &quot;can approach&quot; Hotchkiss, and so on.</p>
