<p>Most domestic furniture consists of supporters and containers of one size or another. This means that the simplest furniture needs no elaborate instructions:</p>

<p>The examples below are therefore mostly ways to get around the usual restrictions on containers (that they only have one interior) and supporters (that they cannot simultaneously be containers as well).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Yolk of Gold</span> provides a set of drawers, that is, a container with multiple interiors.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">U-Stor-It</span> provides a way to have containers with a lid which is also a supporter.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Swigmore</span> provides a supporter which holds up the player, but has no top surface as such, and cannot hold up anything else. <span class="boldface">Kiwi</span> demonstrates a kind of high shelf, whose objects cannot be seen or used unless the player stands on a ladder.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Princess and the Pea</span> shows how a pile of supporters, each on top of the last, could be managed.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Tamed</span> demonstrates furniture large enough to get inside, or on top of.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Circle of Misery</span> demonstrates a conveyor belt, which can hold multiple items but only brings one of them within the player's reach at a time.</p>
