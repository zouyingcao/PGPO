<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.11. Understanding values</p>
<p>&quot;Understand&quot; can be used to supply new ways to talk about both things and other values. For instance, if we create:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1360" -->
<a id="c1360"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A brass lantern is in the Building.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then it can be called &quot;brass&quot;, or &quot;lantern&quot;, but not &quot;lamp&quot;: Inform does not really know what these words mean, and has no grasp of synonyms. We can arrange for &quot;lamp&quot; to work as well like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1361" -->
<a id="c1361"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;lamp&quot; as the lantern.
<br />Understand &quot;old lamp&quot; as the lantern.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>With care, we can do the same trick for entire kinds of thing at once. It is not ordinarily the case that a thing can be called by the name of its kind: if we put a woman called April into a room, then she can usually be called &quot;April&quot;, but not &quot;woman&quot;. (The exception is when we do not specify any name for her - in that case, Inform will give up and call her just &quot;woman&quot;.) So there is not usually any form of words which can refer to anything of a given kind. If we should want this, we have to say so explicitly:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1362" -->
<a id="c1362"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;machine&quot; as a device.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Device is a kind, so now the word &quot;machine&quot; can be used to refer to any device: if there are two in the same place, the result might play out like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1363" -->
<a id="c1363"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;switch machine on
<br />Which do you mean, the bale twiner or the grain thresher?
<br />&gt;twiner
<br />You watch absorbed as a perfect cube of hay is trussed up like a parcel.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Similarly, we might conceivably want to allow new ways to recognise values - in this case, a number:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1364" -->
<a id="c1364"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;eleventy-one&quot; as 111.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When making complicated names, we need to watch out for the possibility of writing a definition which will cause Inform to go around in circles (something which will show up as a &quot;Too many activities at once&quot; run-time problem). For instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1365" -->
<a id="c1365"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;[thing] substitute&quot; as the placebo.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will fail because Inform, working left to right, needs to look for every possible object name before it can progress: one possibility is the placebo itself: to check that, it needs to look for every possible object name: and so on, never finishing. A definition like this one very likely matches too much in any case (would we really want to accept PLACEBO SUBSTITUTE or CIGARETTE SUBSTITUTE SUBSTITUTE SUBSTITUTE here, as the definition implies?).</p>
