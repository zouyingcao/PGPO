<p class="sectionheading">ยง15.15. The parts of a number specification</p>
<p>We often need to break up a number specification into its pieces. For instance, suppose we want to know the dollars part of $1.99? We can do this by naming the parts:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1189" -->
<a id="c1189"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A monetary value is a kind of value. $1.99 specifies a monetary value with parts dollars and cents.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can now find the relevant parts like so. Suppose that &quot;sum&quot; is a monetary value. Then:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1190" -->
<a id="c1190"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
dollars part of sum
<br />cents part of sum
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are both numbers, so for instance we can</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1191" -->
<a id="c1191"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;Looks like around [dollars part of sum in words] dollar[s].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can also go the other way:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1192" -->
<a id="c1192"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
monetary value with dollars part 4 cents part 72
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces the monetary value $4.72. (Note the lack of commas or &quot;and&quot;s, and that the parts have to be given in the right order.) This is really intended to be useful when we manipulate such values in unusual ways:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1193" -->
<a id="c1193"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An aspect ratio is a kind of value. 16:20 specifies an aspect ratio with parts width and height.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1194" -->
<a id="c1194"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide which aspect ratio is the wider version of (AR - an aspect ratio):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let W be the width part of AR multiplied by 2;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let H be the height part of AR;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the wider ratio be the aspect ratio with width part W height part H;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on the wider ratio.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Declaring the parts of a number specification individually also enables us to tack one or more options onto any of the parts:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1195" -->
<a id="c1195"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A monetary value is a kind of value. $1.99 specifies a monetary value with parts dollars and cents (optional, preamble optional).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This declares that the &quot;cents&quot; part is optional - it will be 0 if not specified - and that if omitted, the non-numeric &quot;preamble&quot; before it should also be omitted. Thus &quot;$3&quot; is now valid and equivalent to &quot;$3.00&quot;: indeed it will be the preferred form when Inform prints out a monetary value which is an exact number of dollars. If we had said that &quot;cents&quot; was optional, but not said that the preamble was optional, then &quot;$3.&quot; would have been the form - which is less satisfactory.</p>
<p>There is only one other option: &quot;without leading zeros&quot;, as in the following.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1196" -->
<a id="c1196"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An aspect ratio is a kind of value. 16:20 specifies an aspect ratio with parts width and height (without leading zeros).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This ensures that when the ratio 4:3 is printed, it will be printed as &quot;4:3&quot; and not &quot;4:03&quot; as would otherwise happen.</p>
