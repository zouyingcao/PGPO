<p>Everything has one and only one kind. This is both good and bad: good for clarity, bad if something needs to behave in two different ways at once. How might we simulate a car with an ignition key, given that no single thing can be both a &quot;vehicle&quot; and a &quot;device&quot; at the same time?</p>
<p>The Inform world model takes the view that such a car is too complicated to be simulated with a single thing. Instead it should be simulated as a vehicle (the car) which has a device (the ignition) attached. This is done using a third kind of containment to those seen so far (&quot;in...&quot; and &quot;on...&quot;): &quot;part of&quot;.</p>

<p>The machine and the desk each have several &quot;parts&quot; representing subsidiary pieces of themselves. The desk is a &quot;supporter&quot; (it needs to be, for the liquorice twist to be on top) but also has three &quot;containers&quot; attached, each of which can be opened or closed independently.</p>
<p>In the interests of realism, the standard rules of play protect these composite things. Thus if the desk were to be moved elsewhere (rolling on sugar casters perhaps) then its parts would move with it, and the player is not allowed to detach parts of things: the drawers can be opened or closed, but not pulled out altogether.</p>
<p>Note that rooms and regions are not allowed to have parts. (Rooms are already parts of regions, and to divide up rooms, we can either make several rooms or place containers or other obstacles in a single one.)</p>
