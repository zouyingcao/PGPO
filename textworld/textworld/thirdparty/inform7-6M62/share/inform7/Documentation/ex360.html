<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.7. New either/or properties</p>
<p>Properties can't be handed out completely freely. In the previous chapter, we saw that we were allowed to make a chair &quot;portable&quot; and to make a room &quot;dark&quot;. But if we try this the other way round, Inform produces a Problem message. This is because every property must be created in a way which lays out what values are allowed to have it. The Standard Rules built into Inform say that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c215" -->
<a id="c215"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing can be fixed in place or portable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and as a result it won't allow &quot;The Savannah is portable&quot; because the Savannah is a room, not a thing.</p>
<p>We must do the same. To go back to our example &quot;dead end&quot; kind:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c216" -->
<a id="c216"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end is either secret or ordinary.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This creates just one new property, not two. The names are taken as the two states of a single either/or property: secret means not ordinary, ordinary means not secret. Alternatively, we could just say:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c217" -->
<a id="c217"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end can be secret.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>in which case the opposite of &quot;secret&quot; would be &quot;not secret&quot;.</p>
<p>Now we have a property which can be given to any value of the kind &quot;dead end&quot;. We're also free to add to the definitions of kinds which already exist, including those built into Inform: for instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c218" -->
<a id="c218"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A room is either indoors or outdoors.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we make the above definitions then all dead ends will be &quot;ordinary&quot; and all rooms &quot;outdoors&quot; unless the source text says otherwise. That is, in the absence of other information it's assumed that an either/or property is not true. We could reverse by writing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c219" -->
<a id="c219"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end is usually secret. A room is usually indoors.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A property can be used by several kinds at once. For example, the built-in either/or property &quot;open&quot; is used by both doors and containers, even though door isn't a kind of container and container isn't a kind of door. In fact, although it's more usual to declare properties for whole kinds, they can actually be given to single values one at a time, if we like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c220" -->
<a id="c220"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The umbrella is carried by the player. The umbrella can be open.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And now the umbrella, which is a thing and not a door or container, can also have the property.</p>
