<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.17. Phrases to decide other things</p>
<p>A condition is a yes/no decision, but we can also take decisions where the result is a value. Suppose we want to create a concept of the &quot;grand prize&quot;, which will have different values at different times in play. Each time the &quot;grand prize&quot; is referred to, Inform will have to decide what its value is, and the following tells Inform how to make that decision:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c825" -->
<a id="c825"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide which treasure is the grand prize:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the Dark Room has been visited, decide on the silver bars;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on the plover's egg.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that we have to say what kind the answer will be: here it's a kind of thing called &quot;treasure&quot; (which we're supposing has already been created), and as it turns out only two treasures are ever eligible anyway (we're also supposing that the plover's egg and the silver bars are treasures already created, of course). And note also that the phrase must in all cases end with a &quot;decide on ...&quot; to say what the answer is:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn139" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn139"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>decide on </b>(value)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_decideon -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in the body of a definition of a phrase to decide a value. It causes the calculation to end immediately, with the outcome being the given value, which must be of the kind expected. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c826" -->
<a id="c826"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide which number is double (N - a number):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let D be N times N;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on D.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Now that we have &quot;grand prize&quot; created, we can use it just as we would use any other value, so for instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c827" -->
<a id="c827"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if taking the grand prize, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As this is something of a dialect difference between English speakers, &quot;what&quot; and &quot;which&quot; are synonymous here, i.e., we could equally well write something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c828" -->
<a id="c828"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide what number is the target score: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(A phrase to decide if something-or-other is exactly the same thing as a phrase to decide a truth state, and indeed, if we want to then we can use &quot;decide on T&quot;, where T is a truth state, in its definition. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c829" -->
<a id="c829"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide if time is short:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the time of day is after 10 PM, decide on true;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on whether or not Jennifer is hurried.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Decide on true&quot; is exactly equivalent to the more normally used &quot;decide yes&quot;, and of course it is optional. The last line is more interesting since it effectively delegates the answer to another condition.)</p>

<p>Suppose we have a game in which the player can climb through windows which overlook rooms below.

<p>Suppose we have a game in which the player can climb through windows which overlook rooms below.

<p>To figure out the height distance between the start room and the destination room, we might have a repeat loop look at all the directions one has to follow along the &quot;best route&quot; path between the two rooms, and record any ups and downs; then subtract the number of &quot;up&quot; steps from the number of &quot;down&quot; steps, and report what remains.</p>
