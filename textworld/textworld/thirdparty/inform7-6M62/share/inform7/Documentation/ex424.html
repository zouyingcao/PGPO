<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.12. Actions as conditions</p>
<p>There are two ways that descriptions of actions can be used as conditions. First, we can simply describe an action, and then the condition will be true if that is what the player is trying to do, and not otherwise:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c676" -->
<a id="c676"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if taking a container, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is actually an abbreviation for the longer, some would say preferable form:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c677" -->
<a id="c677"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if we are taking a container, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Secondly, we can talk about the past as well as the present, which is very useful since interactive fiction often contains situations which are changed by earlier events.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c678" -->
<a id="c678"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of waiting when we have taken the lantern, say &quot;No, your acquisitive nature is roused now, and simply waiting will no longer do.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>More on the past tense later follows in the next section: note that &quot;we are taking&quot; has become &quot;we have taken&quot;. For the rule to apply, it is not enough that the action &quot;taking the lantern&quot; has been tried: it must have succeeded. Note also that it's enough for any actor in the story to have successfully taken the lantern: it doesn't have to be the player.</p>
