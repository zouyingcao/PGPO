<p class="sectionheading">ยง12.4. Persuasion</p>
<p>&quot;Asking ... to try ...&quot; actions run through their Before and Instead rules like any other actions, but then (if no rule has intervened) something different happens: Inform has to decide whether the person asked consents to try the action or not. By default, the answer is always no, and text like the following will be printed:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c843" -->
<a id="c843"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt; will, go west
<br />Will has better things to do.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>However, we can intervene to make the answer &quot;yes&quot;, using a special kind of rule which produces a yes/no answer. The following examples show how we can give broad or narrow permission, as we choose:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c844" -->
<a id="c844"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Persuasion rule for asking people to try going: persuasion succeeds.
<br />Persuasion rule for asking Will to try going west: persuasion succeeds.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Such a rule can either declare that &quot;persuasion succeeds&quot;, or that &quot;persuasion fails&quot;, or make no decision and leave it to another rule to say. If it decides that persuasion fails, it is also allowed to say something, describing why: in that event, the standard message (&quot;Will has better things to do.&quot;) is suppressed. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c845" -->
<a id="c845"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Persuasion rule for asking Will to try going:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Will looks put out, and mutters under his breath.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;persuasion fails.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The following rule, which is really only suitable for testing, makes everybody infinitely obliging:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c846" -->
<a id="c846"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> Persuasion rule for asking people to try doing something: persuasion succeeds.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Supposing that Will does decide to cooperate, a new action is generated:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c847" -->
<a id="c847"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Will going west
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and this is then subject to all of the usual action machinery. For instance, we could write a rule such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c848" -->
<a id="c848"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of Will going west, say &quot;He runs out into the waves, but soon returns, rueful.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So in this case the new action (&quot;Will going west&quot;) failed: but the original action, &quot;asking Will to try going west&quot;, is still deemed to have succeeded - after all, Will <span class="italic">did</span> try. To put it more formally, &quot;asking X to try A&quot; succeeds if the persuasion rules succeed, and otherwise fails.</p>
<p>Note also that &quot;Instead of...&quot; rules written for other people will be treated by Inform as failures, even if we write something like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c849" -->
<a id="c849"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of Will pulling the cord:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The bell rings.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and thus may produce unsatisfactory results such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c850" -->
<a id="c850"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;WILL, PULL CORD
<br />The bell rings.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c851" -->
<a id="c851"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Will is unable to do that.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we wish to write new successful actions for another character, we will need to create appropriate carry out and report rules for them: these will be explained in the sections to follow.</p>
<p>(Finally, note that the mechanism Inform uses to see if we have printed a refusal message of our own, in the event of persuasion rules failing, can be fooled if we write a persuasion rule explicitly ending with a &quot;[paragraph break]&quot; text substitution.)</p>

<p>Notice the difference between the two rules about disorderly conduct: the one for other people says 'the rule succeeds' to make sure that the action is counted as a success and not (as normally happens with instead rules) a failure. Most of the time we don't care whether actions are judged successes or failures, but it matters here, because if we type CHARLES, JUMP and the result fails, then text such as 'Charles is unable to.' will be printed - which would get in the way. So we declare the action a success.</p>
