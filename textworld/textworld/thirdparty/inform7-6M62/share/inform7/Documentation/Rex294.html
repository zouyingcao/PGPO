<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.15. Actions on Multiple Objects</p>
<p>Inform allows a handful of actions - TAKE, DROP, PUT, INSERT - to apply to more than one item at a time, so that the player can move things around easily.</p>
<p>The general principle is that multiple objects are allowed if the actions are likely to be successful but not interesting most of the time, and if they're things that the player could plausibly do all at once. For most actions, the use of ALL would seem weirdly indiscriminate: EAT ALL, say, describes very implausible behavior, and EXAMINE ALL would likely generate a screenful of text at once.</p>
<p>But this is all under our control. To create an action that uses multiples, or to allow the use of multiple objects with an already-existing action, we need to create an understand statement that uses the &quot;[things]&quot; token (note the plural). For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23685" -->
<a id="c23685"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;give [things] to [someone]&quot; as giving it to.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This would let the existing give action apply to multiple objects, in just the same way that &quot;take&quot; does. <span class="boldface">Shawn's Bad Day</span> demonstrates how we might allow EXAMINE ALL to print descriptions of every visible item.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could generate a new action:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23686" -->
<a id="c23686"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;give [things] to [someone]&quot; as multiply-giving it to. Multiply-giving it to is an action applying to one carried thing and one thing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(In theory the language here should perhaps be &quot;several carried things&quot; -- but Inform is still going to process multiply-giving item by item, unless we redirect it. More about this in a moment.)</p>
<p>When handling an action that uses the &quot;[things]&quot; token, the parser makes a list of every item to which it is going to apply the action: this is called the multiple objects list. The multiple objects list can be the result of a vague request (GET ALL) or a specific one involving identical multiples (GET PENNIES, GET THREE APPLES) or a very specific one involving unique, named nouns (GET GERBIL, APPLE, AND POMEGRANATE).</p>
<p>We can manipulate what Inform includes in &quot;ALL&quot; in sentences like TAKE ALL with the &quot;deciding whether all includes...&quot; activity; for instance</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23687" -->
<a id="c23687"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for deciding whether all includes scenery: it does not.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>prevents TAKE ALL from applying to things that can't be moved anyway, avoiding lots of lines like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23688" -->
<a id="c23688"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
tree: That's hardly portable.
<br />swing set: That's hardly portable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A slightly tedious technical note: the multiple objects list is not strictly a list in the standard Inform sense, because it is used so frequently in parsing that it would be cumbersome to handle it with the more flexible but less efficient structure used for lists. However, if we want to manipulate the multiple objects list as though it were an ordinary list -- that is, sort it, rotate it, truncate it, remove entries from it, etc -- we may do so by creating a list like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23689" -->
<a id="c23689"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let L be the multiple object list.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and later after making L conform to our desires:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23690" -->
<a id="c23690"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
alter the multiple object list to L.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform next repeatedly runs the action rulebook for the action generated, using each item from the multiple object list as &quot;noun&quot; in turn (or as &quot;second noun&quot;, if that's where the [things] token appeared in the understand line). Since it is possible to alter the multiple object list before the &quot;generate action rule&quot; portion of the turn sequence consults the rulebooks, we can also affect the order in which the player's matched objects are handled; see <span class="boldface">Formicidae</span>. We should not attempt to change the multiple object list after this point, because this is likely to introduce bugs.</p>
<p>Each time Inform tries the action on a new noun, it prefixes the action-attempt with the name of the item it's currently working on. This is where we get such output as &quot;frog eyeballs:&quot; and &quot;newt toes:&quot; in long lists like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23691" -->
<a id="c23691"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
frog eyeballs: Taken.
<br />newt toes: Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These names are generated by the &quot;announce items from multiple object lists rule&quot; in the action-handling rules; <span class="boldface">Escape from the Seraglio</span> shows how to alter them. In the context of this rule, the thing we are currently printing the name of can be called &quot;the current item from the multiple object list&quot;.</p>
<p>Suppressing names of objects entirely, while occasionally tempting, may have unintended consequences, especially if some of the attempted actions are prevented by check rules that themselves print things. It is safest to suppress the multiple object names in the case where we already know that the action will succeed wherever it is attempted (more often for observational actions like examining than for manipulative actions like taking, or where we mean to completely override default handling).</p>
<p>Given that our hypothetical &quot;multiply-giving&quot; applies to each given object in turn, it might seem to be useless to create &quot;multiply-giving&quot; as an action different from &quot;giving&quot; -- but the convenience is that manipulating the multiple object list makes it possible to group behavior artificially. The trick here is that, on the first pass of the multiply-giving rulebook, we look at the entire multiple object list, perform actions, print output, and set a flag saying that the action has been handled. The flag tells Inform not to do or print anything for any of the subsequent passes through that action rulebook; thus we artificially create a situation where, instead of performing an action on each object in turn, Inform acts once on the entire group. That allows us to assess the cumulative qualities of the group and have the action respond differently than it might when assessing each item individually.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">The Facts Were These</span> demonstrates how we might write an action for GIVE THREE DOLLARS TO MAN or GIVE PIE AND HAT TO MAN where the man would only accept the collective gift when its total proved satisfactory.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Western Art History 305</span> demonstrates how we might allow EXAMINE, which doesn't normally permit multiple objects, to take them, but to give vaguer responses to a mass examination than an individual one.</p>

<p>Occasionally it happens that we want to process an action on multiple items differently than we would if the player had just typed each of the individual actions separately. In this example, the reason is that we can only successfully GIVE items when their combined value passes a certain threshold amount; otherwise the recipient will reject them.</p>
<p>This works as an implementation of money, if we give value only to cash objects (though several other implementations of cash are available, most of which are simpler and more efficient). We could also imagine a mechanic like this being used for a bargaining or auction game as well, given a society that deals in objects rather than credits.</p>
<p>In order to consider all the items in the gift at once, we create an action that applies to multiple objects, but will in fact test the whole object collection during the first pass and print a definitive answer to whether the action succeeded. All subsequent times the game consults the rulebook will be stopped at the very beginning. No further processing will occur or output be printed.</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A subtlety here: we say &quot;things preferably held&quot; to prefer items that the player is holding (so if the player has two dollars in hand and a third lies on the ground, he will use just the two he has).</p>
<p>The second grammar line allows Inform to match things that aren't held if it can't make up the list from things that are. If all three dollars are on the ground, the player can pick them up before spending them.</p>
<p>We do not, however, make multiply-giving apply to a &quot;carried&quot; item, because that will generate implicit takes of those items in a way that will mess up our action reporting. Instead, we're going to build the implicit takes into the system in a different way, one that permits us to collate the reports more attractively and print a short, one-sentence list of anything that the player had to pick up.</p>

<p>Occasionally it happens that we want to process an action on multiple items differently than we would if the player had just typed each of the individual actions separately. In this example, the reason is that we can only successfully GIVE items when their combined value passes a certain threshold amount; otherwise the recipient will reject them.</p>
<p>This works as an implementation of money, if we give value only to cash objects (though several other implementations of cash are available, most of which are simpler and more efficient). We could also imagine a mechanic like this being used for a bargaining or auction game as well, given a society that deals in objects rather than credits.</p>
<p>In order to consider all the items in the gift at once, we create an action that applies to multiple objects, but will in fact test the whole object collection during the first pass and print a definitive answer to whether the action succeeded. All subsequent times the game consults the rulebook will be stopped at the very beginning. No further processing will occur or output be printed.</p>

<p>The bit about making some items &quot;marked for listing&quot;, above, rather than printing the list directly, is that using the &quot;[the list of....]&quot; syntax guarantees that Inform will respect grouping rules in writing its description.

<p>Now we create our own variation of implicitly taking in order to customize the output for the multiply-giving action. The &quot;ungivability rules&quot; should disallow any object that the player absolutely cannot take, because we want &quot;carry out the implicitly taking activity&quot; to succeed every time -- and therefore not print out any less-attractive results from implicit takes that don't succeed. Otherwise, the player's GIVE TREE AND DOG TO ATTENDANT might produce the reply &quot;That's fixed in place&quot; -- without specifying which object is fixed in place.</p>
<p>Because of the way this works, we will want to be careful: if we have any &quot;instead of taking...&quot; rules for special objects in the game, we should be sure to mirror those with an ungivability rule to print something more suitable in the case that the player tries taking that object as part of the multiple giving action.</p>
