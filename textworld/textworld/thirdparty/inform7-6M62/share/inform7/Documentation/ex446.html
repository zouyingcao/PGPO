<p>To recap, then, it is forbidden to multiply 122kg and 10kg, not because it could never make sense (a scientist might occasionally multiply two weights) but because the result is - what? Not a number, and not a weight any more. But we are allowed to tell Inform what the result ought to be, and once we have done so, the multiplication will be allowed:</p>

<p>And having told Inform that lengths multiply to area, we could also divide an area by a length to get a length: no further instructions would be needed.</p>
<p>The built-in &quot;Metric Units&quot; extension includes all of the standard ways that physical quantities are multiplied, and a good way to see these is to try out one of the Metric Units examples and look at the Kinds index, which includes a table showing how all of this works.</p>

<p>Suppose that we have a number of objects in the game that are sized in some conventional unit (such as meters), but which we would like to describe in slightly less formal terms. To do this, we will start with measurements as defined in the built-in extension Metric Units, so we don't have to recreate all these.</p>
<p>We'll add our own set of &quot;conceptual units&quot; -- things we're familiar with in real life. As we'll see below, Inform will automatically choose a unit of the right order to express a given distance if we tell it to print a length &quot;in conceptual units&quot;.</p>
<p>Note: the following will compile only if you have settings set for Glulx. (To change this, go to the Settings panel and click on the Glulx option.) The Glulx virtual machine is capable of handling larger numbers than the Z-machine.</p>
