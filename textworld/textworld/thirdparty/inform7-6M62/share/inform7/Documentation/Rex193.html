<p>It is too easily assumed that room descriptions are what the player sees, but as <span class="boldface">The Undertomb</span> demonstrates, they might just as easily include ambient sounds.</p>
<p>So Inform's &quot;listening to&quot; action is the audio equivalent of &quot;examining&quot;, rather than &quot;looking&quot;. Despite this the player can type LISTEN, which Inform understands as listening to the everything in the location at once. A simple but effective way to handle this is shown in <span class="boldface">The Art of Noise</span>.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Four Stars 2</span> adjusts the idea of &quot;visibility&quot; to make it behave differently for listening purposes: this introduces a formal idea of &quot;audibility&quot;.</p>

<p>As we have seen, a well-written understand rule will often solve the problem of allowing the player to apply specific actions to objects not normally in scope. When we need to adjust scope for some other reason than reading the player's command, though, &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; may come in handy.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we wanted to extend Four Stars 1 to add a tomcat on the balcony that will be heard whenever the player listens from the next room, as in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c29599" -->
<a id="c29599"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;listen
<br />You hear the soothing whalesong from the Bose speaker and the yowling from the tomcat.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To do this, we need to make sure that in the rule that assembles our listening description,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c29600" -->
<a id="c29600"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of listening to a room:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if an audible thing can be touched by the player, say &quot;You hear [the list of audible things which can be touched by the player].&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise say &quot;A merciful peace prevails.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>now includes the tomcat in the &quot;list of audible things which can be touched by the player&quot;.</p>
<p>To this end, we're going to change the way we assess scope, but only during the listening action. Otherwise the tomcat remains in the other room and off-limits. The new source text is marked out below:</p>

<p>As we have seen, a well-written understand rule will often solve the problem of allowing the player to apply specific actions to objects not normally in scope. When we need to adjust scope for some other reason than reading the player's command, though, &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; may come in handy.</p>
<p>For instance, suppose we wanted to extend Four Stars 1 to add a tomcat on the balcony that will be heard whenever the player listens from the next room, as in:</p>
