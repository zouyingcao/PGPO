<p class="sectionheading">ยง21.11. Variations: arrays, logs, queues, stacks, sets, sieves and rings</p>
<p>Lists are highly adaptable, and many other collection-like constructions can be made using them. This section introduces no new material, but simply suggests some of the variations which are possible.</p>
<p>1. The traditional computing term <span class="boldface">array</span> means a list of values accessed by their entry numbers, often used in mathematical computations. The difference between an array and a list is mostly one of attitude, but usually arrays are fixed in length whereas lists can expand or contract.</p>
<p>2. A <span class="boldface">log</span> is a list which records the most recently arrived values, but does not allow itself to grow indefinitely. In the following, which remembers the seven most recently taken items, new values arrive at the end while old ones eventually disappear from the front:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1815" -->
<a id="c1815"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The most-recently-taken list is a list of objects that varies.
<br />Carry out taking something (called the item):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;truncate the most-recently-taken list to the last 6 entries;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;add the item to the most-recently-taken list.
<br />After taking:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Taken. (So, your recent acquisitions: [most-recently-taken list].)&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that the most-recently-taken list begins play as the empty list, grows as the first few items are taken, but then stabilises at length 7 thereafter. If we need to remember recent history, but only <span class="italic">recent</span> history, then a log is better than a list which can grow indefinitely, because there is no risk of speed reduction or memory exhaustion in a very long story.</p>
<p>3. A <span class="boldface">queue</span> is a list of values which are waiting for attention. New values join at the back, while those being dealt with are removed from the front (whereupon the whole queue moves up one). An empty queue means that nobody is waiting for attention: but there is, in principle, no upper limit to the size of a queue, as anyone who has tried to make a couchette reservation at Roma Termini will know.</p>
<p>Queues typically form when two independent processes are at work, but going at different or variable speeds. An empty queue looks just like any other list:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1816" -->
<a id="c1816"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The queue is a list of objects that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Invariably people, in what follows, but we'll make it a &quot;list of objects&quot; to allow for other possibilities too.) Once we identify a &quot;new customer&quot;, we can join him to the queue thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1817" -->
<a id="c1817"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
add the new customer to the queue;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The process of serving the customers needs to make sure there is actually somebody waiting in the queue before it does anything:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1818" -->
<a id="c1818"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn when the number of entries in the queue is not 0:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the next customer be entry 1 of the queue;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The next customer] is served and leaves.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;remove entry 1 from the queue.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Of course queues can also be constructed which empty from other positions, rather than the front: or we could make what computer scientists sometimes call a <span class="boldface">deque</span>, a &quot;double-ended queue&quot; where new values arrive at both ends.</p>
<p>4. A <span class="boldface">stack</span> is like a queue except that values arrive at, and are removed from, the same end. Stacks are slightly faster if the active end is the back rather than the front, though this will only be noticeable if they grow quite large.</p>
<p>To put a value V onto a stack S (which is known as &quot;pushing&quot;) is simple:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1819" -->
<a id="c1819"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
add V to S;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And to remove a value from the top of the stack (which is known as &quot;pulling&quot;):</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1820" -->
<a id="c1820"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let N be the number of entries in S;
<br />let V be entry N of S;
<br />remove entry N from S;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that the middle line, accessing entry N, will fail if N = 0, that is, if the stack is empty: Inform's list routines will produce a run-time problem message.</p>
<p>Stacks are useful if some long-term process is constantly being interrupted by newer and more urgent demands, but they can also be used in planning. If a character has a long-term goal, which needs various short-term goals to be achieved along the way, then a stack can represent the goals currently being pursued. The top of the stack represents what the character is trying to achieve now. If the character realises that it needs to achieve something else first, we put that new goal onto the top of the stack, and it becomes the new current goal. When the character completes a task, it can be removed, and we can go back to trying to finish whatever is now on top. When the stack is empty, the character has achieved the original goal.</p>
<p>5. Notoriously, <span class="boldface">set</span> has 464 distinct meanings in the Oxford English Dictionary, making it the single most ambiguous word in the language. Here we mean not the home of a badger or the Egyptian god of the desert, but the mathematical sense: a collection of values (sometimes called &quot;elements&quot;) without duplicates, and which is normally written in brace notation and in some natural order for the reader's convenience.</p>
<p>The trick here is to maintain the principle that, at all times, our list is sorted in order and contains no duplicates. To provide an example, we start with two sets of numbers:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1821" -->
<a id="c1821"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let S be {2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64};
<br />let T be {2, 4, 6, 10};
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we add an element to T:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1822" -->
<a id="c1822"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
add 8 to T, if absent; sort T;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;if absent&quot; clause ensures that no duplicate can occur, and by sorting T afterwards, we maintain the principle that a set must remain in order - so T is now {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, not {2, 4, 6, 10, 8}. (Inform's sorting algorithm is fast on nearly-sorted lists, so frequent sorting is not as inefficient as it might look.)</p>
<p>We next take the union of T and S, that is, the set containing everything which is in either or both:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1823" -->
<a id="c1823"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let U be S; add T to U, if absent; sort U;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This makes U = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 16, 32, 64}, and once again no duplicates occur and we preserve the sorting. The intersection of T and S, the set of elements in both of them, is a little trickier:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1824" -->
<a id="c1824"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let I be T;
<br />repeat with the element running through T:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the element is not listed in S, remove the element from I.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Faster methods could be devised which exploit the sortedness of T and S, but are not worth it for shortish lists.) This produces I = {2, 4, 8}. Lastly, we can form the set difference, consisting of those elements which are in S but not in T:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1825" -->
<a id="c1825"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let D be S; remove T from D, if present;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here, as with intersection, since all we do is to strike out unwanted elements, the surviving ones remain in order and there is no need to sort when we are finished. This produces D = {16, 32, 64}.</p>
<p>6. A <span class="boldface">sieve</span> is used to make a complicated choice where there are many constraints, by ruling out impossible cases to see what is left. The term derives from the kitchen utensil (for sieving fine grains of flour), but via the name of the &quot;sieve of Eratosthenes&quot;, an ancient Greek method for determining the prime numbers.</p>
<p>Using a sieve is much like using a set, and the difference is mainly one of outlook - we are interested in what does not belong, rather than what does.</p>
<p>7. A <span class="boldface">ring</span> is not so much a row of values, more a circle, with the last and first entries thought of as adjacent. One position is usually thought of as special, and is the place where new items are added: this may as well be entry 1. For instance, to add &quot;new item&quot; to the ring:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1826" -->
<a id="c1826"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
add the item at entry 1 in the ring;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To set &quot;item&quot; to the frontmost value and extract it from the ring:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1827" -->
<a id="c1827"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let the item be entry 1 of the ring;
<br />remove entry 1 from the ring;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And we can rotate the ring in either direction, making a different entry the new entry 1 and therefore the new frontmost value:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1828" -->
<a id="c1828"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
rotate the ring;
<br />rotate the ring backwards;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A last note to conclude the chapter on lists. Lists, like almost all other values in Inform, can be passed to phrases as parameters. However, note that they are genuine values, not what some programming languages call &quot;references&quot; or &quot;pointers&quot;. So the following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1829" -->
<a id="c1829"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To mess with (L - a list of numbers):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;add 7 to L, if absent.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>does nothing, in practice. If given a list, it adds 7 to the list, but then throws it away again, so the longer list is never seen; it's exactly like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1830" -->
<a id="c1830"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To mess with (N - a number):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now N is 3.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which can never affect anything other than its own temporary value &quot;N&quot;, which expires almost immediately in any case.</p>
<p>If we want a phrase which changes a list in a useful way and gives it back to us, we need a phrase which both takes in and gives back:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1831" -->
<a id="c1831"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide which list of numbers is the extended (L - a list of numbers):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;add 7 to L, if absent;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on L.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And then, for example -</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1832" -->
<a id="c1832"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the extended { 2, 4, 6 };
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1833" -->
<a id="c1833"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
{ 2, 4, 6, 7 }
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(This may seem surprising since Inform's built-in phrases to adjust lists, like &quot;add ... to ...&quot;, don't work this way. But those are written using Inform 6 code; see the phrase definitions in the Standard Rules for more.)</p>
