<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.13. New tokens</p>
<p>We have now made good use of square-bracketed tokens, such as &quot;[something]&quot;, in a variety of &quot;Understand...&quot; sentences. It is sometimes convenient to create new tokens of our own, to match whatever grammar we choose: this enables complicated knots of grammar to be used in many different &quot;Understand...&quot; sentences without having to write it all out each time.</p>
<p>For instance, here are new tokens: one for each of two groups of alternative prepositions.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1371" -->
<a id="c1371"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;beneath/under/by/near/beside/alongside/against&quot; or &quot;next to&quot; or &quot;in front of&quot; as &quot;[beside]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1372" -->
<a id="c1372"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;on/in/inside&quot; or &quot;on top of&quot; as &quot;[within]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Again, note that the slash indicates a choice between words only, not between entire phrases. For instance, if we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1373" -->
<a id="c1373"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;red bird/robin&quot; as &quot;[robin]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the two alternative forms are &quot;red bird&quot; and &quot;red robin&quot;, not &quot;red bird&quot; and &quot;robin&quot;. By contrast,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1374" -->
<a id="c1374"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;red bird&quot; or &quot;robin&quot; as &quot;[robin]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will understand either &quot;red bird&quot; or &quot;robin&quot; but not &quot;red robin&quot;. If we want to capture all three forms, we might define</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1375" -->
<a id="c1375"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;red bird/robin&quot; or &quot;robin&quot; as &quot;[robin]&quot;.
