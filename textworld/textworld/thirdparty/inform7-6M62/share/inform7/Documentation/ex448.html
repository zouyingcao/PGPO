<p>We are allowed to link the beginning or end of any scene to the beginning or end of any other scene. So, for instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c718" -->
<a id="c718"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble is a scene. Luggage Trouble begins when Brief Encounter begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Thus the two scenes run concurrently, at least for a while. We can also add that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c719" -->
<a id="c719"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble ends when Brief Encounter ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This can be useful when a large, complicated scene really contains several smaller sub-scenes.</p>
<p>A special exceptional case is that we can have any scene or scenes starting right at the outset:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c720" -->
<a id="c720"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Railway Meeting is a scene. Railway Meeting begins when play begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When play ends, of course, all scenes end, so there is no need to say that.</p>

<p>For some games, it makes sense to organize the entire game around scenes rather than around locations, moving the player when a new scene begins and laying out new props.</p>
<p>To this end, we might extend Inform's default handling of scenes so that each scene has properties to indicate prop lists and locations, and move objects in and out of play automatically as the scenes change. For instance:</p>
