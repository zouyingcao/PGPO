<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.20. Multiple action processing</p>
<p>When the player types a command like DROP ALL, this is (usually) a request to carry out more than one action. After the command parser has decided what constitutes &quot;ALL&quot; (a process which can be influenced using the &quot;deciding whether all includes&quot; activity), it forms up a list and then runs through it, starting an action for each in turn. The result usually looks something like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1412" -->
<a id="c1412"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;GET ALL
<br />foxglove: Taken.
<br />snake's head fritillary: Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>However, by adding rules to the rulebook:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1413" -->
<a id="c1413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
multiple action processing rules
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>we can take a look at the actions intended, and rearrange or indeed change them before they take effect. To do that, we have to deal with a special list of objects. For two technical reasons this isn't stored as a &quot;list of objects that varies&quot; - first because it needs to exist even in low-memory situations where we can't afford full list-processing, and second because there are times when changing it might be hazardous. Instead, two phrases are provided to read the list and to write it back:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn245" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn245"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>multiple object list ... list of objects</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_multipleobjectlist -->

<p>This phrase produces the current multiple object list as a value. The list will be the collection of objects found to match a plural noun like ALL in the most recent command typed by the player. If there is no multiple object, say if the command was TAKE PEAR, the list will be empty: it won't be a list of size 1.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn246" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn246"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>alter the multiple object list to </b>(list of objects)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_altermultipleobjectlist -->

<p>This phrase sets the multiple object list to the given value. The list is ordinarily the collection of objects found to match a plural noun like ALL in the most recent command typed by the player, but using this phrase at the right moment (before the &quot;generate action rule&quot; in the turn sequence rules takes effect).</p>
