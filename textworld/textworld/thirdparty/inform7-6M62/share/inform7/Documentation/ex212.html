<p class="sectionheading">ยง19.5. Changing the behaviour of rules</p>
<p>Here is another way to abolish an already-existing rule:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1595" -->
<a id="c1595"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print final score rule does nothing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The rule continues to be listed in any rulebook it would normally be listed in: but now it doesn't do anything. More usefully, we can attach a condition:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1596" -->
<a id="c1596"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print final score rule does nothing if the score is 0.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1597" -->
<a id="c1597"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print final score rule does nothing unless the score is 100.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can also substitute a rule of our own:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1598" -->
<a id="c1598"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
This is the print fancy final score rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Oh my, you scored a mammoth [score]!&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1599" -->
<a id="c1599"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print fancy final score rule substitutes for the print final score rule.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and once again a condition can be applied:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1600" -->
<a id="c1600"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print fancy final score rule substitutes for the print final score rule when the score is greater than 100.
</p></blockquote>
