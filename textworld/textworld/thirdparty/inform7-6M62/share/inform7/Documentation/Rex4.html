<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.4. Scene Changes</p>
<p>In a plot that takes place over multiple locations or has several distinct scenes, we may want to move the player or change the scenery around him. <span class="boldface">Age of Steam</span> brings a train on and off-stage as the plot requires. <span class="boldface">Meteoric</span> similarly brings a meteor into view at a certain time of day, showing off several implementations depending on whether or not the player is supposed to be able to refer to the meteor after it has gone.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Entrevaux</span> constructs an organized system such that all scenes have their own lists of props and associated locations, and props are moved on and off automatically. Scene changes are also announced with a pause and a new title, such as &quot;Chapter 2: Abduction&quot;.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Space Patrol - Stranded on Jupiter</span> inserts an interlude in which the player's possessions and clothes are switched for new ones and the player moved to a new location - and then put back where he started from.</p>

<p>American radio adventure series of the 1950s were unobtrusively sponsored by breakfast cereals, as the following modest example demonstrates. Note that the scene-changing for the commercial break needs to know nothing about the actual programme it breaks into: if Part I were replaced with a different Space Patrol episode, Part II need not be changed at all.</p>
