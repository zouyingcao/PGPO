<p class="sectionheading">ยง14.9. Verbs as values</p>
<p>Each verb known to Inform is actually a value of the kind &quot;verb&quot;. To refer to a verb as a value, we have to put the word &quot;verb&quot; in front, as in these examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1080" -->
<a id="c1080"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the verb contain, the verb might, the verb provoke
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>all of which appear in the Standard Rules.</p>
<p>Two adjectives are provided for use with verbs: &quot;modal&quot; (or &quot;non-modal&quot;) to pick out verbs like might, could, should, and so on; and &quot;meaningful&quot; (or &quot;meaningless&quot;) to pick out verbs which have a defined meaning as an Inform relation. For example, in the Standard Rules, the verb contain is meaningful, the verb might is modal, and the verb provoke is meaningless.</p>
<p>If V has a meaning as a relation of objects, then &quot;meaning of V&quot; produces that relation. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1081" -->
<a id="c1081"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
showme the meaning of the verb contain;
<br />showme the meaning of the verb provoke;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1082" -->
<a id="c1082"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;meaning of the verb contain&quot; = relation of objects: containment relation
<br />&quot;meaning of the verb provoke&quot; = relation of objects: equality relation
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As this demonstrates, if a verb has no meaning, or its meaning doesn't relate to objects, we get just the equality relation.</p>
<p>In fact, Inform even defines a verb &quot;to mean&quot;: it's meaningful, and its meaning is the meaning relation. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1083" -->
<a id="c1083"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the verb mean means the meaning relation...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is true. More usefully, we can search our vocabulary like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1084" -->
<a id="c1084"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the list of verbs meaning the containment relation
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which, unless any non-Standard Rules definitions have been added, produces:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1085" -->
<a id="c1085"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
list of verbs: {verb contain}
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that the meaning relation can't be changed at run-time: it is not clear what it would even mean to do something like -</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1086" -->
<a id="c1086"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the verb contain means the wearing relation;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>with the story already started, so this will produce a problem message.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn170" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn170"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[adapt </b>(verb)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_adapt -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the current story tense and story viewpoint. For example, &quot;you [adapt the verb provoke]&quot; might produce &quot;you provoke&quot;.</p>

<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_adaptv -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the current story tense but the given viewpoint. For example, &quot;he [adapt the verb provoke from the third person singular]&quot; might produce &quot;he provokes&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn172" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn172"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[adapt </b>(verb)<b> in </b>(grammatical tense)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_adaptt -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the given tense but the current story viewpoint. For example, &quot;you [adapt the verb provoke in the past tense]&quot; might produce &quot;you provoked&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn173" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn173"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[adapt </b>(verb)<b> in </b>(grammatical tense)<b> from </b>(narrative viewpoint)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_adaptvt -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the given tense and viewpoint. For example, &quot;we [adapt the verb provoke in the future tense from the first person plural]&quot; might produce &quot;we will provoke&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn174" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn174"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[negate </b>(verb)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_negate -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the current story tense and story viewpoint, giving it a negative sense. For example, &quot;you [negate the verb provoke]&quot; might produce &quot;you do not provoke&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn175" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn175"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[negate </b>(verb)<b> from </b>(narrative viewpoint)<b>]&quot;</b></p>

<!-- end definition -->

<div class="definition"><a id="defn176"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[negate </b>(verb)<b> in </b>(grammatical tense)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_negatet -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the given tense but the current story viewpoint, giving it a negative sense. For example, &quot;you [negate the verb provoke in the past tense]&quot; might produce &quot;you did not provoke&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn177" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn177"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[negate </b>(verb)<b> in </b>(grammatical tense)<b> from </b>(narrative viewpoint)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_negatevt -->

<p>Adapts the given verb to the given tense and viewpoint, giving it a negative sense. For example, &quot;we [negate the verb provoke in the future tense from the first person plural]&quot; might produce &quot;we will not provoke&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Note that the verb doesn't have to be named explicitly for use by the adapt or negate phrases, so for example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1087" -->
<a id="c1087"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide which text is the rendering of (V - verb) (this is my rendering):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide on &quot;[negate V in the past perfect tense]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1088" -->
<a id="c1088"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;showme my rendering applied to the list of meaningful verbs.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1089" -->
<a id="c1089"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;my rendering applied to the list of meaningful verbs&quot; = list of texts: {&quot;had not had&quot;, &quot;had not related&quot;, &quot;had not meant&quot;, &quot;had not provided&quot;, &quot;had not contained&quot;, &quot;had not supported&quot;, &quot;had not incorporated&quot;, &quot;had not enclosed&quot;, &quot;had not carried&quot;, &quot;had not held&quot;, &quot;had not worn&quot;, &quot;had not been able to see&quot;, &quot;had not been able to touch&quot;, &quot;had not concealed&quot;, &quot;had not unlocked&quot;}
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Lastly, we can get at three other useful parts of a verb, too. These aren't adaptive, of course: a verb only has one infinitive form.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn178" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn178"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[infinitive of </b>(verb)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_infinitive -->

<p>Produces the infinitive of the given verb. Note that this is without a &quot;to&quot;: for example, &quot;[infinitive of the verb carry]&quot; is &quot;carry&quot;, not &quot;to carry&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn179" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn179"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[past participle of </b>(verb)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_pastpart -->

<p>Produces the past participle of the given verb. For example, &quot;[past participle of the verb carry]&quot; is &quot;carried&quot;. Warning: because modal verbs like &quot;should&quot; or &quot;might&quot; are defective in English, this will produce odd results on them - &quot;shoulded&quot; and &quot;mighted&quot;, for example.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn180" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn180"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[present participle of </b>(verb)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_prespart -->

<p>Produces the present participle of the given verb. For example, &quot;[present participle of the verb carry]&quot; is &quot;carrying&quot;. Warning: because modal verbs like &quot;should&quot; or &quot;might&quot; are defective in English, this will produce odd results on them - &quot;shoulding&quot; and &quot;mighting&quot;, for example.</p>
