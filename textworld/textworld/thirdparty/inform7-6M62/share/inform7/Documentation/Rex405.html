<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.16. Social Groups</p>
<p>Crowds of characters introduce new challenges, because we often want to show them interacting with one another, or to describe individuals in less detail when a whole group is present.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Strictly Ballroom</span> gives us a set of characters who pair off each turn, making sure to mention each one once, and leaving one unfortunate person behind as a wallflower: this exemplifies how we might use a behavioral rule not to dictate the behavior of each individual separately but rather to model a whole group together. <span class="boldface">Happy Hour</span> does calculate movements for characters individually, but then collates the descriptions, creating a single paragraph to describe whatever group is currently in the room.</p>
<p>Characters can also have complicated attitudes to one another, and it can be helpful to use relations to track these. <span class="boldface">Unthinkable Alliances</span> demonstrates the grouping of characters into alliance factions, while <span class="boldface">The Abolition of Love</span> provides a host of relations to track love affairs, marriages, memberships in families, and mere mutual respect.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Emma</span> combines these two effects: its characters move between social groups depending on how they feel about the others in their particular talking circle, and descriptions change depending on who is where in the room.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Lugubrious Pete's Delicatessen</span> simulates a queue at a deli, in which the customers who most impress Pete get served first.</p>
