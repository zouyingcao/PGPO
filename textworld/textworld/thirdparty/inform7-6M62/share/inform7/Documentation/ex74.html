<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.5. New activities</p>
<p>Activities are all about influencing the standard mechanisms which Inform uses, so it might at first seem that there is no need to create new activities: but on further reflection, quite a lot of the writing of interactive fiction involves creating new and systematic ways to do things, and as soon as we have a general rule, we will want to have exceptions. Inform therefore allows us to create our own activities, giving us ways to influence the operation of our own mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of activity: those which relate to a specific value (usually an object but not necessarily), and those which do not. Here are some examples of activities being created:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1440" -->
<a id="c1440"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Assaying is an activity.
<br />Analysing something is an activity.
<br />Announcing something is an activity on numbers.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform looks for the clue &quot;something&quot; (or &quot;of something&quot;) after the activity's name to see if it will work on a value: so analysing and announcing will do, but assaying won't. If we don't specify a kind, Inform assumes the value will be an object, as if we had written:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1441" -->
<a id="c1441"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Analysing something is an activity on objects.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As always in Inform, the names of activities are themselves values.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1442" -->
<a id="c1442"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;assaying activity&quot; has kind activity on nothing
<br />&quot;analysing activity&quot; has kind activity on objects
<br />&quot;announcing activity&quot; has kind activity on numbers
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Creating an activity is like creating an action: it automatically makes new rulebooks - &quot;before analysing&quot;, &quot;for analysing&quot; and &quot;after analysing&quot; - but they start out empty, so the activity does nothing yet. Just as it does for rulebooks, Inform defines the adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot; for activities to test this state:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1443" -->
<a id="c1443"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the analysing activity is empty, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true only when all three of its rulebooks are empty.</p>
<p>A newly created activity never happens unless we take steps to make it do so. We can make an activity happen at any time by writing phrases like so:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn247" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn247"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>carry out the </b>(activity)<b> activity</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_carryout -->

<p>This phrase carries out the given activity, which must be one not applying to any value. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1444" -->
<a id="c1444"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
carry out the assaying activity;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn248" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn248"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>carry out the </b>(activity on values)<b> activity with </b>(value)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_carryoutwith -->

<p>This phrase carries out the given activity, which must apply to a kind of value matching the one supplied. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1445" -->
<a id="c1445"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br />carry out the announcing activity with the score;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>To make the activity do something useful, we need to put a rule into its &quot;for&quot; rulebook:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1446" -->
<a id="c1446"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for announcing a number (called N): say &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, [N].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1447" -->
<a id="c1447"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The last for assaying rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Professionally, you cast an eye around mineral deposits nearby, noticing [list of rocks in the location].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;The last&quot; is a technicality about rulebooks (see the next chapter) which, put briefly, guarantees that this rule comes last among all possible &quot;for assaying&quot; rules. This is good form because the whole point of an activity is to make it easy for further rules to interfere - so we deliberately hang back to last place, giving precedence to anybody else who wants it.</p>
<p>The &quot;for&quot; rulebook is one where rules stop the activity, by default, when they take effect - in the same way that the &quot;instead&quot; rules stop actions by default. If this causes problems, we can use:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn249" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn249"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>continue the activity</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_continueactivity -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in rules in activity rulebooks. It causes the current rule to end, but without result, so that the activity continues rather than stopping as a result of the rule. This is useful for rulebooks (like the &quot;for&quot; rulebook of an activity) where the default is that a rule does stop the activity.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Activities are more useful than they first appear. Every new one provides a context which other activities can observe. We could, for instance, define</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1448" -->
<a id="c1448"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of a rock while assaying: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>so that during assays more technical names are used.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a complete Encyclopedia in our game. The player is allowed to pick up the whole set (there must not be too many volumes), but also to do things with individual volumes, and indeed to scatter these volumes all over the place.
