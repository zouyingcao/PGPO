<p class="sectionheading">ยง27.5. A simple example extension</p>
<p>Extensions are plain text files, and can be created with any text editor. (It is sometimes said that &quot;there is no such thing as plain text&quot;, there being so many ways to represent exotic characters: so to be precise, an extension is a text file with the Unicode UTF-8 encoding, either with or without a BOM marker, using any of the possible forms of line-ending (Unix, Windows, Macintosh, or Unicode line divider). This is a detail which will only matter if the extension contains accented letters or other exotica.)</p>
<p>Extensions look very much like passages of Inform source, because except for a special introductory and concluding sentence, and one convention, that is all they are:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2047" -->
<a id="c2047"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Ducking Action by Graham Nelson begins here.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0022=]An action for ducking one[=0x0027=]s head.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Ducking is an action applying to nothing.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2048" -->
<a id="c2048"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;An action for ducking one's head.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2049" -->
<a id="c2049"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Ducking is an action applying to nothing. Report ducking: say &quot;You duck!&quot; Understand &quot;duck&quot; as ducking.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2050" -->
<a id="c2050"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Ducking Action ends here.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Not a useful or interesting extension, but those few words add a whole new action and everything needed to make it work. It is Inform's ability to mix up rooms, things, kinds, grammar, phrases and rules, in more or less any order, which makes it possible for extensions to work.</p>
<p>The introductory sentence must be placed as the only content of line 1 of the file, which must not contain comments, and has to be written in exactly the correct form. Inform checks this very carefully when performing its census of installed extensions, on each translation of the text. (In case the extension's title is a plural, we are allowed to write &quot;begin&quot; and &quot;end&quot; instead of &quot;begins&quot; and &quot;ends&quot;. For instance, the last line of the standard rules is &quot;The Standard Rules end here.&quot;)</p>
<p>The &quot;one convention&quot; mentioned above is that if a double-quoted text is placed immediately after the beginning sentence (and with no intervening comments), then it is taken to be a short description of the extension's content called the &quot;rubric&quot;. Hence the line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2051" -->
<a id="c2051"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;An action for ducking one's head.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Providing a rubric is helpful, because it enables Inform to give a meaningful listing even for an as-yet unused and unindexed extension, and because it helps the Inform website to produce better directories. Note the word &quot;short&quot;: such text is likely to be truncated if it exceeds 500 characters.</p>
<p>A second double-quoted text can also, optionally, be added in yet a third special starting paragraph. This is to provide additional credits to people who have contributed to this or earlier versions. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c2052" -->
<a id="c2052"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Ducking Action by Graham Nelson begins here.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2053" -->
<a id="c2053"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;An action for ducking one's head.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c2054" -->
<a id="c2054"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;based on original Inform 6 code by Marc Canard&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note the typical style here: it's a phrase rather than a sentence, and neither starts with an upper-case letter nor ends with a full stop. (The additional credit is then used in documentation and also in the VERSION text of any Inform story file using the extension.)</p>

<p>Suppose we want to write an extension or other portable code which defines a &quot;kitchen&quot; kind of room and a &quot;bathroom&quot; kind of room. All kitchen rooms we create in the future will automatically contain standard kitchen appliances: fridge, freezer, sink with taps, counters, cabinets, and a stovetop with built-in oven. Similarly, all bathrooms will have sinks, baths, cabinets, and toilets, and respond to some standard interactions.</p>

<p>Now we might put this to work in a short example.</p>
<p>One slight challenge lies in giving these assembled pieces separate descriptions. When we have an assembly that adds parts to objects, we can then talk about (for instance) &quot;the stove's switch&quot; elsewhere in the code. But items that have been assigned rooms are not named in the same way, so we cannot talk about &quot;the Industrial Kitchen's stove&quot; in our code as a way to assign it a description or special behavior. In quite a simple example, we could make the descriptions of the kind simply be the descriptions we want for the individual items:</p>

<p>Or we might even (if we anticipate lots of these kinds of amendments) want to rig up something more complex that finds the descriptions of appliances in a table, rather than relying on their individual description properties. This can all be done, but it is only interesting as long as it remains genuinely labor-saving: that is, as long as the convenience of having the assembly is greater than the annoyance of writing special rules to cover for the automation. In the end, the &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bathroom&quot; room types are likely to be most useful for authors who want to include the standard props but not actually make them a critical part of the game; if stoves and sinks have more of a starring role in the production, authors may be better off coding them or at the very least placing them by hand, as in</p>

<p>All these quirks are things that we (as the extension author) want to think out in advance: we should ideally warn authors about possible pitfalls in using our extension (if we can think of them) and point out ways of customizing the behavior (if there are interesting ways).</p>

<p>Now we might put this to work in a short example.</p>
<p>One slight challenge lies in giving these assembled pieces separate descriptions. When we have an assembly that adds parts to objects, we can then talk about (for instance) &quot;the stove's switch&quot; elsewhere in the code. But items that have been assigned rooms are not named in the same way, so we cannot talk about &quot;the Industrial Kitchen's stove&quot; in our code as a way to assign it a description or special behavior. In quite a simple example, we could make the descriptions of the kind simply be the descriptions we want for the individual items:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or we might even (if we anticipate lots of these kinds of amendments) want to rig up something more complex that finds the descriptions of appliances in a table, rather than relying on their individual description properties. This can all be done, but it is only interesting as long as it remains genuinely labor-saving: that is, as long as the convenience of having the assembly is greater than the annoyance of writing special rules to cover for the automation. In the end, the &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bathroom&quot; room types are likely to be most useful for authors who want to include the standard props but not actually make them a critical part of the game; if stoves and sinks have more of a starring role in the production, authors may be better off coding them or at the very least placing them by hand, as in</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>All these quirks are things that we (as the extension author) want to think out in advance: we should ideally warn authors about possible pitfalls in using our extension (if we can think of them) and point out ways of customizing the behavior (if there are interesting ways).</p>

<p>This is probably about as far as we want to go in a generic simulation: it is tempting to code up water, drains down which the player can lose objects, sinks that get clogged and overflow, and so on; but the more we embellish in these ways, the more likely the end result would be disruptive to individual games. For right now what we're aiming for is something simple which provides the basic interactions a player might expect in this kind of room, but which does not have any significant implications for the surrounding world model.</p>
<p>A particularly conservative author might even want to make it turn out that the water has been shut off and nothing flows from the taps: in the extension documentation, we might want to include a line or two of example showing how this might be done by changing or removing the relevant rules of our extension.</p>

<p>Or we might even (if we anticipate lots of these kinds of amendments) want to rig up something more complex that finds the descriptions of appliances in a table, rather than relying on their individual description properties. This can all be done, but it is only interesting as long as it remains genuinely labor-saving: that is, as long as the convenience of having the assembly is greater than the annoyance of writing special rules to cover for the automation. In the end, the &quot;kitchen&quot; and &quot;bathroom&quot; room types are likely to be most useful for authors who want to include the standard props but not actually make them a critical part of the game; if stoves and sinks have more of a starring role in the production, authors may be better off coding them or at the very least placing them by hand, as in</p>
