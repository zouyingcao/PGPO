<p class="sectionheading">ยง15.19. Arithmetic with units</p>
<p>The example equations in the previous section carried out quite a lot of arithmetic, but they may have given the impression that Inform always allows arithmetic - which is not true.</p>
<p>This is actually a good thing, because it keeps us from error. For instance, Inform will not allow:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1226" -->
<a id="c1226"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Equation - Newton's Totally Bogus Law
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;F = m^2
<br />where F is a force, m is a mass.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because whatever you get when you square a mass, you don't get a force - in the same way that a length times another length makes an area, not another length. Physicists call this &quot;dimensional analysis&quot;, and it often provides clues about which equations are right. Just after the Second World War, someone correctly worked out the explosive power of an atomic bomb without any classified information simply by guessing what values would appear in the formula, and then finding the simplest equation they could appear in.</p>
<p>In general, Inform will not allow numerical kinds of value to be multiplied or divided by each other (or square or cube rooted) unless we give it instructions that this would make sense.</p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty we can still do without any need for such instructions. For instance, going back to weight,</p>

<p>...will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 300kg.&quot; Here Inform knows that it makes sense to multiply a weight by 3, and that the result will be a weight. Similarly, Inform allows us to add and subtract weights, and several different forms of division are allowed:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When we visit the Weighbridge, we find:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1229" -->

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Whereas we are not allowed to divide 122 by 10kg: that would make no sense, since 122 is a number and not made up of kilograms. Inform will produce a problem message if we try. Similarly, Inform won't normally allow us to multiply two weights together - but see the next section.</p>
