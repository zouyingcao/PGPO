<p class="sectionheading">ยง12.6. Spontaneous actions by other people</p>
<p>The player's actions happen not only when he types a command, but can also happen spontaneously as a result of a &quot;try&quot; phrase.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c857" -->
<a id="c857"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
try going west
<br />try asking Will to try going west
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The latter might, of course, result in Will trying going west: or it might not - that depends on the persuasion rules. But as the author, we have the ultimate powers of persuasion, and can make Will act in any way we like, without asking:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c858" -->
<a id="c858"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
try Will going west
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Nobody in the simulated world requested this: it is an impulse felt by Will alone, so that - from the player's point of view - Will is acting spontaneously. The player need not be anywhere nearby, and may never know what happened. Recall that when actions work their way down through the flow-chart, they are stopped before reaching the &quot;report&quot; stage - when the player is told about them - if they are running &quot;silently&quot;. This is also where Inform stops an action which is not witnessed by the player.</p>
<p>To repeat a point in the previous section: &quot;unsuccessful attempt&quot; rules do not apply to actions which the author has caused to happen, using &quot;try&quot;. When such actions fail, they invoke no special set of rules. Indeed, when &quot;try&quot; causes somebody other than the player to try an action, nothing will be printed to report back on success or failure. If Will can't go west, that's his problem.</p>
<p>Note that the text &quot;try Will going west&quot; involves the actor's name immediately placed next to the action he is to try, which in a very few cases might cause ambiguities. If the actor's name contains a participle like &quot;going&quot; - say, if Will's full name turned out to be Mr Will Going - then we would have to write out the action name in full, using &quot;trying&quot; to clarify matters:</p>
