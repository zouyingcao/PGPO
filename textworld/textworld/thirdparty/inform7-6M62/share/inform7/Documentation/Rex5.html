<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.5. Kitchen and Bathroom</p>
<p>Before implementing elaborate mechanisms to handle plumbing, we should pause to ask ourselves: how much of this do we need? Is it really necessary to simulate the complete set of fixtures and fittings?</p>
<p>This turns out to be a little tricky to do, and also rather dull to set out. The example <span class="boldface">Modern Conveniences</span> was actually written as a demonstration of how an extension to Inform might be written to provide a general &quot;kitchens and bathrooms service&quot; for writers, but it contains a nice implementation well worth borrowing. The idea is to provide a &quot;kitchen&quot; kind of room and a &quot;bathroom&quot; kind of room. All kitchens created automatically contain standard kitchen appliances: fridge, freezer, sink with taps, counters, cabinets, and a stovetop with built-in oven. Similarly, all bathrooms will have sinks, baths, cabinets, and toilets, and respond to some standard interactions.</p>
<p>Another common feature of bathrooms is a mirror: <span class="boldface">Versailles</span> demonstrates how to create a simple one.</p>
