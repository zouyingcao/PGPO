<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.29. Deciding the scope of something</p>
<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> &quot;Scope&quot; is a term of art in interactive fiction programming: it means the collection of things which can be interacted with at any given moment, which depends on who you are and where you are. Commands typed by the player will only be allowed to go forward into actions if the things they refer to are &quot;in scope&quot;. Inform also needs to determine scope at other times, too: for instance, when deciding whether a rule conditional on being &quot;in the presence of&quot; something is valid. It is a bad idea to say anything during this activity.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> Is complicated: see the Inform Designer's Manual, 4th edition, page 227. Briefly, the scope for someone consists of everything in the same place as them, unless it is dark.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) We very rarely want to forbid the player to refer to things close at hand, but often want to allow references to distant ones. For instance, a mirage of something which is not present at all:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1535" -->
<a id="c1535"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After deciding the scope of the player while in the Shrine: place the holy grail in scope.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Two different phrases enable us to place unusual items in scope:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn262" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn262"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>place </b>(object)<b> in scope</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_placeinscope -->

<p>This phrase should only be used in rules for the &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; activity. It places the given object in scope, making it accessible to the player's commands, regardless of where it is in the model world. Examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1536" -->
<a id="c1536"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
place the distant volcano in scope;
<br />place the lacquered box in scope, but not its contents;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Ordinarily if something is placed in scope, then so are its parts and (in the case of a supporter or a transparent or open container) its contents; using the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option we can place just the box itself in scope.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn263" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn263"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>place the</b>/--<b> contents of </b>(object)<b> in scope</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_placecontentsinscope -->

<p>This phrase should only be used in rules for the &quot;deciding the scope of...&quot; activity. It places the things inside or on top of the given object in scope, making them accessible to the player's commands, but it does nothing to place the object itself in scope. (It might of course be in scope anyway, and if it is then this phrase won't remove it.) Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1537" -->
<a id="c1537"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
place the contents of the lacquered box in scope;
<br />place the contents of the Marbled Steps in scope;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that the object in question can be a room, as in this second example.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>(b) Another useful device is to be able to see, but not touch, another room:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1538" -->
<a id="c1538"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('The Cloakroom is a room. [=0x0022=]This is just a cloakroom, but through a vague, misty mirror-window you can make out the Beyond.[=0x0022=] After looking in the Cloakroom, say [=0x0022=]In the mirror you can see [list of things in the Beyond].[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]After deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The Beyond is a room.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1539" -->
<a id="c1539"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After deciding the scope of the player while in the Cloakroom: place the Beyond in scope.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1540" -->
<a id="c1540"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Beyond is a room. Johnny Depp is a man in the Beyond.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(This must, however, also be a mirage, as at time of writing Mr Depp is alive and as well as can be expected following the reviews of &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot;.) Note that &quot;place the Ballroom in scope&quot; doesn't just allow the player to talk about the dancers, the chamber musicians and so forth, also allows, say, &quot;EXAMINE BALLROOM&quot;. To get one but not the other, use &quot;place the contents of the Ballroom in scope&quot; or &quot;place the Ballroom in scope, but not its contents&quot;.</p>
<p>(c) In darkness, the scope of someone is ordinarily restricted to his or her possessions (and body), but we can override that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1541" -->
<a id="c1541"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After deciding the scope of the player while in darkness: place the location in scope.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p><span class="boldface">4. A note about actions.</span> This activity takes place during the process of understanding the player's command, when the action that will take place is not fully known. So if the player types &quot;TAKE SHOEBOX&quot;, this activity would happen when SHOEBOX is being examined for meaning. Inform knows the action it would be taking if the current line of command grammar were to be accepted, but it does not yet know to what objects that command would be applied. That means attaching a proviso like &quot;... while taking a container&quot; to a rule for this activity will cause the rule to have no effect - whereas &quot;... while taking&quot; would be fine.</p>

<p>Sadly, because the grape is small, the player will never encounter this horror.</p>
<p>Alternatively, suppose we have a situation in which the player can use one command to interact with a kind of thing that isn't normally in scope. It's usually most convenient to write the &quot;understand&quot; rule appropriately rather than use the scope activity.</p>
<p>(Note that we define &quot;inquiring about&quot; as applying to one *visible* thing; otherwise we would be required to be able to touch the catsuit in order to inquire about it. More on this restriction may be found in the Advanced Actions chapter on the topic of visible, touchable, and carried things.)</p>
