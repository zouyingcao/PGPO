<p class="sectionheading">ยง19.15. Two rulebooks used internally</p>
<p>Rulebooks handle almost all of the important tasks which an Inform work of IF must carry out in order to keep play going. We have seen them used in clarifying the player's command, supplying missing ingredients, processing the action to see what should happen, responding, and so on: by this point in the documentation, it must look as if Inform uses rulebooks for everything.</p>
<p>This is nearly true. There is not actually a super-rulebook controlling everything. (Such a super-rulebook would need to repeat itself and never finish, something a rulebook is not allowed to do.) Instead, what happens during play looks like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1654" -->
<a id="c1654"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
1. Following the &quot;when play begins&quot; rulebook.
<br />2. Repeating:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2(a). Reading and parsing a command into an action;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2(b). Following the &quot;action processing&quot; rulebook;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;2(c). Following the &quot;turn sequence&quot; rulebook.
<br />until the story has finished.
<br />3. Following the &quot;when play ends&quot; rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The command parser occasionally calls on the services of activity rulebooks to help it, but otherwise gets on with its job in ways that we do not &quot;see&quot; as Inform 7 users. The rest of what happens involves rulebooks, and in particular two important beneath-the-surface rulebooks: action processing and turn sequence.</p>
<p>The <span class="boldface">action processing rules</span> are used whenever an action must be tried, by whoever tries it. This usually happens in response to player commands, but not always: it might happen because of a &quot;try...&quot;, and it can certainly interrupt an existing action.</p>
<p>The <span class="boldface">turn sequence rules</span> are used at the end of each turn, and include housekeeping as well as timekeeping. They consult the &quot;every turn&quot; rulebook, and advance the time of day, among other useful tasks.</p>
<p>In general, we should only modify the operation of these two crucial rulebooks as a last resort. Play can evidently fall to pieces if they cease to work normally.</p>
