<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.4. During scenes</p>
<p>Scenes are not only useful for changing the setting, by moving items or people around and providing a little narration. We can also make the rules different in one scene from another. For instance, at a sleepy country halt there is no reason why one should not walk across the tracks: but if there is a train in the way, that would be impossible.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c711" -->
<a id="c711"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going north during the Train Stop, say &quot;The train blocks your way.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Any rule can have the clause &quot;during ...&quot; attached, provided that clause goes at the end and either explicitly names a scene, or gives a description of which scenes would match. This is especially useful with &quot;every turn&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c712" -->
<a id="c712"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn during the Train Stop, say &quot;Water is sluiced out of the tank and into the engine.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can test whether a scene is happening with the adjective &quot;happening&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c713" -->
<a id="c713"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Train Stop is happening, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START PHRASE "defn115" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn115"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has happened:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hashappened -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has both begun and ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn116" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn116"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not happened:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasnothappened -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has not ended (or never started).</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn117" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn117"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has ended:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasended -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene ended at least once.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn118" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn118"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(scene)<b> has not ended:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_hasnotended -->

<p>This condition is true if the given scene has never ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We need to be a bit careful: it's possible to set things up so that the Train Stop scene will play out more than once, so &quot;Train Stop is happening&quot; and &quot;Train Stop has happened&quot; might both be true at once.</p>
<p>The kind of value &quot;scene&quot; is one which is allowed to have properties - it has a tick in the &quot;properties&quot; column in the chart in the Kinds index - and this can be very useful in describing scenes. For instance, we could write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c714" -->
<a id="c714"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A scene can be thrilling or dull. Train Stop is dull.
<br />A scene has a text called cue speech. The cue speech of Train Stop is &quot;All aboard!&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform has the adjectives &quot;recurring&quot;, &quot;non-recurring&quot; and &quot;happening&quot; all built in to describe scenes, and the above would add &quot;thrilling&quot; and &quot;dull&quot;. Moreover, the &quot;during&quot; clause of a rule can give a description of a scene as easily as a specific scene name. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c715" -->
<a id="c715"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going north during a dull non-recurring scene, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<p>And then we define the scene so that it ends when the table runs out.</p>

Lecture ends when the number of filled rows in the Table of Lecture Events is 0.

<p>One advantage of this is that we can then edit the events in the scene by changing just the table; the scene will always run the right length and end on the turn when the last event occurs.</p>
<p>And to add a few additional details:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c19842" -->
<a id="c19842"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of doing something other than waiting, looking, listening or examining during Lecture:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Dr Freitag glares at you so fiercely that you are frozen into inaction.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Notice the careful phrasing of &quot;doing something other than...&quot; so that we do not mention the objects; if we had written &quot;something other than listening to something...&quot;, the instead rule would match only action patterns which involved a noun. We state the rule more generally so that it will also match nounless commands such as JUMP and SING, since Freitag will probably take a dim view of those as well.</p>
