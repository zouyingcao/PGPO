<p>There are two further ways to examine the historical record. Given any condition, we can say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c687" -->
<a id="c687"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if (...condition...) for the second time ...
<br />if (...condition...) twice ...
<br />if (...condition...) 2 times...
<br />if (...condition...) two times...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(all of which are synonymous: the words once, twice, thrice, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth all mean what they obviously should). The result is true if the condition holds now and has held for only one previous spell in the past. A condition holding for, say, fifteen consecutive turns without a break counts as only one &quot;time&quot; - so what we mean by &quot;twice&quot; here is that it is true now, was previously false for a while, and was previously true for a while before that, but no more. In effect, then,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c688" -->
<a id="c688"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player is in the Ballroom for the third time ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is true if this is the third visit to the Ballroom. We can also say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c689" -->
<a id="c689"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player is in the Ballroom for more than the third time ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or similarly &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;at most&quot;. It would be more natural, though, to say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c690" -->
<a id="c690"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player has been in the Ballroom three times ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The adjective &quot;only&quot; (or equivalently &quot;exactly&quot;) can be added to obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c691" -->
<a id="c691"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player has been in the Ballroom only three times ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To recap, this means there have been exactly three visits to the Ballroom in history, whereas</p>
<!-- START CODE "c692" -->
<a id="c692"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player is in the Ballroom for the third time ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>means there have been exactly three visits, the third of which is still going on - an important distinction.</p>
