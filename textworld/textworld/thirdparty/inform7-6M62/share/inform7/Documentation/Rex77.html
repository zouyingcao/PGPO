<p>We may want to change the default refusal message when the player tries to pick up scenery: <span class="boldface">Replanting</span> demonstrates this case simply.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Removal</span> modifies responses to successful TAKE commands, with the effect that when the player picks up an item, he gets a response such as &quot;You take the book from the shelf.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Croft</span> modifies the DROP command, so that objects dropped on specific surfaces get reported in a special way. <span class="boldface">Celadon</span> allows the player to drop even objects he is carrying indirectly, for instance on a tray or in a sack.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Morning After</span> introduces a simple rule that changes the behavior of the whole story: whenever the player takes an item he hasn't already looked at, he automatically examines it. This picks up the pace of exploration passages where the player is likely to be collecting a large number of objects.</p>
<p>By default, when the player tries to put or insert an item that he isn't holding, Inform prints a refusal message; <span class="boldface">Democratic Process</span> and <span class="boldface">Sand</span> offer ways instead to have the player first pick up the relevant items. (The former applies to single items the player is trying to place; the latter expands coverage to work even if the player uses a command affecting multiple objects.)</p>
<p>Taking also happens as a result of other commands. Such takes can be made unnecessary by turning off the &quot;carrying requirements rule&quot; under particular circumstances, or presented differently using the implicitly taking activity.</p>
