<p class="sectionheading">ยง12.15. Out of world actions</p>
<p>The actions seen so far are all impulses causing the protagonist inside the fictional world to do something, or at least try to. But when the player types &quot;quit&quot; or &quot;save&quot;, that is not a request for anything to happen in the fictional world: it is an instruction to the program simulating that world. In fact, just the same, such requests are treated as actions, but of a special category called &quot;out of world&quot; actions. They do not cause time to pass by, so the turn counter does not advance, nor does this command cycle count as a turn at all; and they are altogether exempt from &quot;Before&quot;, &quot;Instead&quot; and &quot;After&quot; rules. Only the player is allowed to try them.</p>
<p>We can also create new out-of-world actions. Suppose we want a dialogue like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c899" -->
<a id="c899"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;ROOMS
<br />You have been to 1 out of 8 rooms.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here is a complete implementation:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c900" -->
<a id="c900"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Requesting the room tally is an action out of world.
<br />Report requesting the room tally: say &quot;You have been to [number of visited rooms] out of [number of rooms] room[s].&quot;
<br />Understand &quot;rooms&quot; as requesting the room tally.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It is important not to use &quot;out of world&quot; actions for anything affecting what goes on in the fictional world, or realism will collapse, and action-processing may also fail to work in the usual way. &quot;Out of world&quot; actions should be reserved for providing commands like ROOMS, which monitor events rather than participate in them.</p>

The answer varied, but sometimes the last point was earned by never saving the game - in other words by playing it right through with nothing to guard against mistakes (except perhaps UNDO for the last command), and in one long session.</p></td><td class="egcrossref"><!-- START IGNORE -->
