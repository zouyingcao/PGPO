<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.3. Event Scheduling</p>
<p>We can use a schedule of events to give some life to our environment: if we have a town setting, for instance, it makes sense for shops and libraries to open and close at set times; this is just what we find in <span class="boldface">IPA</span>.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Air Conditioning Is Standard</span> has characters who follow a timed schedule of events to interact with each other, while the player mostly wanders around missing out on the action. (Sometimes life is like that.) The same effects could have been achieved with scenes instead of clock times, but there are occasions when we do want to plan our characters' behavior to the minute rather than waiting for the player to be in the right place to observe it: in a murder mystery or a time-travel story, the exact timings might be quite significant.</p>
<p>We may also want to add events to the schedule during play, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23611" -->
<a id="c23611"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
 Instead of pushing the egg-timer: say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;; the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23612" -->
<a id="c23612"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
At the time when the egg-timer clucks: say &quot;Cluck! Cluck! Cluck! says the egg-timer.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Similarly, we can schedule things during play to happen at a specific time of day, as shown in <span class="boldface">Hour of the Wren</span>.</p>
