<p class="sectionheading">ยง12.19. Changing visibility</p>
<p>Ordinarily, Inform has a simple model for visibility: it is either fully light or it is fully dark, and certain actions are impossible in the dark, such as examining something.</p>
<p>We first need to remember that darkness affects what actions are even tried, as far as the player's typed commands go. If the player is in a dark room, and there is a screwdriver on the floor, the command EXAMINE SCREWDRIVER will not try any action: the screwdriver is not &quot;in scope&quot;, which means that the parser thinks the player does not have any means of knowing it exists. (The rules for scope can be modified - see the chapter on Activities.) But let's suppose that the player types EXAMINE BOOK, and is holding the book in question. The book is now &quot;in scope&quot;, so the action &quot;examining the book&quot; is tried.</p>
<p>Some actions require light to be present, and &quot;examining&quot; is one of those. So Inform consults the visibility rules to see if it can go ahead. By default, there is only one visibility rule, which says &quot;yes&quot; in the light and &quot;no&quot; in darkness. Here, though, we create another one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c911" -->
<a id="c911"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Visibility rule when in darkness:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if examining the book:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You have to squint. Still...&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;there is sufficient light;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;there is insufficient light.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A visibility rule must always conclude &quot;there is sufficient light&quot;, or &quot;there is insufficient light&quot;, or else do nothing and leave it to other rules to decide.</p>
<p>It is a possibly unexpected fact that &quot;looking&quot; does not require light, but instead behaves differently in darkness - it prints a pseudo-room-description such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c912" -->
<a id="c912"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<span class="boldface">Darkness</span>
<br />It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>instead of printing the description of the player's current room. This means that the &quot;looking&quot; action is unaffected by visibility rules. All the same, what &quot;looking&quot; does in the dark can be changed by using the two activities &quot;printing the name of a dark room&quot; and &quot;printing the description of a dark room&quot; (see the Activities chapter for details).</p>
