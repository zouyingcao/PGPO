<p>In many cases, if K is the name of a kind of value, then Inform automatically makes an Understand token called &quot;[K]&quot; which matches only values of K. An example is &quot;[number]&quot;, which matches text like 203 or SEVEN. There is a chart of the kinds of value in the Kinds index for a project, showing which ones can be understood in this way.</p>
<p>In particular, any newly created kind of value can always be understood. We make good use of that in the example story &quot;Studious&quot;:</p>

<p>Note the way we can refer to the limb mentioned by the player as the &quot;limb understood&quot;. Similarly, we could talk about the &quot;number understood&quot; if the value parsed had been a number, and so on.</p>
<p>One of the built-in kinds of value is worth special note: time. A time can hold either a specific time of day, such as 10:23 PM, or a duration of something, such as 21 minutes. The &quot;[a time]&quot; token matches times of day, such as 10:15 AM or MIDNIGHT. But 10 MINUTES wouldn't be recognised by &quot;[a time]&quot; since it isn't a specific moment in the day. To get around this, an alternative version called &quot;[a time period]&quot; is available. So:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1356" -->
<a id="c1356"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;wait for [a time period]&quot; as ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>would match WAIT FOR AN HOUR or WAIT FOR TWO HOURS 12 MINUTES.</p>

<div class="egpanel" id="example299">
<p>Suppose we have a book that the player must consult page-by-page, and we want to be able to accept all of the following input:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c15760" -->
<a id="c15760"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt; READ BOOK (to choose a random page and read it)
<br />&gt; READ PAGE 1 IN BOOK
<br />&gt; READ PAGE 2
<br />&gt; READ THE LAST PAGE OF THE BOOK
<br />&gt; READ THE NEXT PAGE
<br />&gt; READ PREVIOUS PAGE IN BOOK
<br />&gt; READ THE FIRST PAGE
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>One approach would be to write many different understand rules and actions: one action for reading randomly, one for reading a specific page, one for reading the first page, one for reading the previous page, one for reading the next page, and one for reading the last page. But this gets tedious to construct and maintain.</p>
<p>More usefully, we could consider that all of the last four options are essentially the same action at heart: the player is asking to read a page in the book using a name rather than a number, and we will have to perform a minor calculation to discover what the number should be. Here's an implementation using named values to resolve this problem:</p>
