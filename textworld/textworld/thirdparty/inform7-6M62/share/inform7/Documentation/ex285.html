<p>Lastly we can also ask for a more specific number of possibilities, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c457" -->
<a id="c457"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if two women are carrying animals
<br />if at most three doors are open
<br />if fewer than 10 portable containers are closed
<br />if all but two of the devices are switched on
<br />if there are more than six locked doors
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Likewise for &quot;less than&quot;, &quot;at least&quot;, &quot;all except&quot;. Something to watch out for is that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c458" -->
<a id="c458"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if two doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be found true if there are (say) three open doors: after all, if three doors are open, then certainly two doors are. So this is not quite counting. We can be more precise by writing</p>
<!-- START CODE "c459" -->
<a id="c459"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if exactly two doors are open
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;all but&quot; counts - say, &quot;if all but two doors are open&quot; - are exact: if, in fact, all of the doors are open then this will be found false.</p>
<p>We can often use these counting forms with values, too. As with the use of &quot;all&quot;, this is allowed only if the kind of value is one which can reasonably be searched through. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c460" -->
<a id="c460"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if more than three scenes are happening
<br />if there are more than two non-recurring scenes
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are allowed because the built-in kind of value &quot;scene&quot; (of which much more later on) has only a small number of possible values.</p>
<p>Lastly, note that the &quot;the&quot; in text like &quot;two of the doors&quot; matters: without it, the phrase will not be recognised as a requirement on the number. (This is to make sure that names of things like &quot;two of hearts&quot; are not misinterpreted.)</p>
