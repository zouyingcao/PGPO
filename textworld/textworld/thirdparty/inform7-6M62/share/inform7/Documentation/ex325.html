<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.5. Conditions and questions</p>
<p>A variety of &quot;conditions&quot; have already appeared in this documentation. A condition is a phrase which describes a situation which might be true, or might be false, and examples might include:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c762" -->
<a id="c762"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Kite is in Bishopsgate
<br />the score is greater than 10
<br />Sherlock Holmes suspects a woman
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These are all examples of sentences, formed by putting nouns either side of a verb, and clearly a wide range of conditions can be written this way. But there are also a few special conditions built into Inform which have a fixed wording, and test questions difficult to address with ordinary sentences. For instance:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn121" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn121"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if in darkness:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_indarkness -->

<p>This condition is true if the player currently has no light to see by. Note that the test is more complicated than simply testing</p>
<!-- START CODE "c763" -->
<a id="c763"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player is in a dark room, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>since the player might have a torch, or be inside a cage which is itself in a dark room, and so on.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Another example of a condition not easily written as a sentence is:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn122" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn122"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if player consents:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_consents -->

<p>This condition is unusual in doing something and not simply making a silent check: it waits for the player to type YES (or Y) or NO (or N) at the keyboard, and then is true if the answer was yes. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c764" -->
<a id="c764"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;Are you quite sure you want to kiss the Queen? &quot;;
<br />if the player consents:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Whether it's put to the player like this or not, testing a condition is really asking a question, and there is always a yes/no answer. In Inform this answer is not usually a value (unlike in some other computer programming languages), but it can be made into one.</p>
<p>Firstly, we need a special kind of value to hold answers like this. It's called &quot;truth state&quot;, and it has just two possible values, written as &quot;true&quot; and &quot;false&quot;. We then need:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn123" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn123"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>whether or not </b>(a condition)<b> ... truth state</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_whether -->

<p>This phrase converts a condition into its result as a value, which is always either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c765" -->
<a id="c765"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
whether or not 20 is an odd number
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces the truth state &quot;false&quot;. This is mostly useful for storing up results to look at later:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c766" -->
<a id="c766"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let victory be whether or not all the treasures are in the cabinet;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and then subsequently:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c767" -->
<a id="c767"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if victory is true, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>As another example, in most stories this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c768" -->
<a id="c768"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;showme whether or not in darkness.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...will produce a line:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c769" -->
<a id="c769"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;whether or not in darkness&quot; = truth state: false
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In short, &quot;truth state&quot; is a kind of value like any other. That means it can be the kind of a variable:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c770" -->
<a id="c770"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Salvation earned is a truth state that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and it can similarly be used in table columns, lists, or anywhere else where values are allowed.</p>
