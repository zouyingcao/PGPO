<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.2. Scripted Scenes</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to arrange a scene in which something goes on in the background (as though it were a movie playing) while the player goes about his business; or where a series of things has to happen before the player gets to the end.</p>
<p>The simplest way to arrange background events for a scene is to write the sequence of events into a table and work our way through it, printing one line per turn, until the scene runs out. <span class="boldface">Day One</span> does exactly this.</p>
<p>At other times, we want a scene to last as long as it takes the <span class="italic">player</span> to do something. <span class="boldface">Entrapment</span> lets the player poke around and explore as much as he likes, but ends as soon as he has accomplished the scene's goal - which, unfortunately for him, is to get into an embarrassing situation so that another character can walk in and make fun of him. <span class="boldface">The Prague Job</span> has a scene that requires the player to do a more specific set of tasks, but nags him and hurries him along until he's done.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Bowler Hats and Baby Geese</span> assumes that our story is going to be assembled with a number of scenes, some of which will need to prevent the player from leaving the location until the scene is complete: it thus defines a &quot;restricted&quot; property for scenes, so that all such elements of the plot will work in the same way.</p>
<p>For more complex sorts of scripts and schedules, it may be worth consulting the extensions.</p>
