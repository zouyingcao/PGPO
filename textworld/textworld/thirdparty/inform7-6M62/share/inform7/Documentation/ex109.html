<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.6. The time of day</p>
<p>Inform keeps track of the time of day automatically: play ordinarily begins at 9 AM and each turn takes one minute. In some works of interactive fiction, time of day is crucial: in others, it is irrelevant or even, by a sort of tacit convention, non-existent. So Inform does nothing to act upon the time, or to reveal it to the player, without instruction. Nevertheless it is there.</p>
<p>A sentence like the following allows the initial time to be set up as something other than 9 AM:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c650" -->
<a id="c650"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The time of day is 3:13 PM.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here, &quot;3:13 PM&quot; is a constant value of a kind not seen before: it's a kind of value called &quot;time&quot;, and the value &quot;time of day&quot; is a time that varies. After one turn it will be 3:14 PM, then 3:15 PM and so on.</p>
<p>Note that the sentence above is an assertion (a statement about the initial state of affairs), not an instruction which can be part of a rule. It would be equivalent to write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c651" -->
<a id="c651"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins: now the time of day is 3:13 PM.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We more often change &quot;time of day&quot; to take care of drastic events:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c652" -->
<a id="c652"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
At the time when the player loses consciousness:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the time of day is 10:12 AM;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;A mist comes over your vision, and when you come to, it is morning and you are in bed.&quot;
