<p>When we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c201" -->
<a id="c201"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end is usually dark.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>we are saying that it will be dark rather than lighted unless we should specify otherwise. So it would be fine to add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c202" -->
<a id="c202"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Tortuous Alcove is lighted.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because although dead ends are usually dark, this one is evidently an exception. On the other hand, if we had originally written</p>
<!-- START CODE "c203" -->
<a id="c203"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A dead end is always dark.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then Inform would not have permitted any exception to be made, and would have reported a problem if we had tried to make the Tortuous Alcove lighted. Besides &quot;usually&quot; and &quot;always&quot;, we can also employ &quot;seldom&quot; and &quot;never&quot;, which are their negatives. Thus, &quot;never lighted&quot; means the same as &quot;always dark&quot;.</p>
