<p class="sectionheading">ยง13.6. Making reciprocal relations</p>
<p>The relationships described in this chapter so far are by no means always reciprocated. For instance, if a stone is on a table, then it is never true that the table is also on the stone. And the question may not even be meaningful to ask. If Peter wears a jacket, the jacket does not even have the possibility of wearing Peter.</p>
<p>But sometimes we do want a relation which works both ways equally well. These are simple to set up:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c952" -->
<a id="c952"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Meeting relates people to each other.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The effect is that various people know various other people, and this is always reciprocated. If Daisy knows Sophie then, automatically, Sophie knows Daisy. This even-handedness is maintained throughout play, so that whatever changes are made it is always true that if A knows B then B knows A.</p>
<p>And similarly for a reciprocal relation between one and another:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c953" -->
<a id="c953"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Marriage relates one person to another.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In this case, we can again give a name to the partner under a relation:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c954" -->
<a id="c954"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Marriage relates one person to another (called the spouse).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and now, for instance, we may have that the spouse of John is Yoko and the spouse of Yoko is John.</p>
<p>Since many of these examples have involved people, it might be worth mentioning again that any kind can be involved, not just the &quot;person&quot; kind.</p>

<p>A note about this scope addition: the player can refer to the other party whenever he has the other person on the phone. He can't, however, see or refer to anything that person might be holding or wearing, thanks to the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the player can't actually do anything to that person that requires touching. That's because of the reaching inside rules, which govern whether the player can reach through intervening barriers such as rooms. (See the Advanced Actions chapter for more about changing reachability.) There are two things we might want to be careful about, though.</p>
<p>First, we should specifically disallow the player from looking at the person on the other end of the line. Since sight doesn't require touching, the reaching inside rules will not be consulted about a command such as EXAMINE BOSS or LOOK UNDER BOSS. We can, however, intervene in such cases using the visibility rules, which are consulted for any actions that &quot;require light&quot; (including EXAMINE and LOOK UNDER). Here again we borrow some options from the Advanced Actions chapter:</p>

<p>Second, though the existing reaching inside rules are adequate to stop us from touching the person on the other end of the line, the response that's currently printed is a bit generic: it just says &quot;You can't reach into [the room containing the person].&quot; Let's add our own custom reply, instead:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A note about this scope addition: the player can refer to the other party whenever he has the other person on the phone. He can't, however, see or refer to anything that person might be holding or wearing, thanks to the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the player can't actually do anything to that person that requires touching. That's because of the reaching inside rules, which govern whether the player can reach through intervening barriers such as rooms. (See the Advanced Actions chapter for more about changing reachability.) There are two things we might want to be careful about, though.</p>
<p>First, we should specifically disallow the player from looking at the person on the other end of the line. Since sight doesn't require touching, the reaching inside rules will not be consulted about a command such as EXAMINE BOSS or LOOK UNDER BOSS. We can, however, intervene in such cases using the visibility rules, which are consulted for any actions that &quot;require light&quot; (including EXAMINE and LOOK UNDER). Here again we borrow some options from the Advanced Actions chapter:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c14803" -->

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Second, though the existing reaching inside rules are adequate to stop us from touching the person on the other end of the line, the response that's currently printed is a bit generic: it just says &quot;You can't reach into [the room containing the person].&quot; Let's add our own custom reply, instead:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A note about this scope addition: the player can refer to the other party whenever he has the other person on the phone. He can't, however, see or refer to anything that person might be holding or wearing, thanks to the &quot;but not its contents&quot; option.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the player can't actually do anything to that person that requires touching. That's because of the reaching inside rules, which govern whether the player can reach through intervening barriers such as rooms. (See the Advanced Actions chapter for more about changing reachability.) There are two things we might want to be careful about, though.</p>
<p>First, we should specifically disallow the player from looking at the person on the other end of the line. Since sight doesn't require touching, the reaching inside rules will not be consulted about a command such as EXAMINE BOSS or LOOK UNDER BOSS. We can, however, intervene in such cases using the visibility rules, which are consulted for any actions that &quot;require light&quot; (including EXAMINE and LOOK UNDER). Here again we borrow some options from the Advanced Actions chapter:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c14859" -->

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Second, though the existing reaching inside rules are adequate to stop us from touching the person on the other end of the line, the response that's currently printed is a bit generic: it just says &quot;You can't reach into [the room containing the person].&quot; Let's add our own custom reply, instead:</p>
