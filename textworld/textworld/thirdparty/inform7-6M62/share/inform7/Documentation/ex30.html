<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> When reading a command from the keyboard.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> Print the prompt text; wait for the player to type something and press return. Reject an entirely blank line, and treat a command beginning &quot;oops&quot; as a correction to the previous one. This is a fairly complicated business, so it is probably best not to change the &quot;for&quot; rules for this activity: &quot;before&quot;, and especially &quot;after&quot;, are another matter. (Note, however, that if Inform does reject a blank line and ask for another then this all happens inside the &quot;for&quot; rules: no &quot;after&quot; occurs after the blank line, nor does a &quot;before&quot; happen before the second attempt by the player. It is all a single round of the activity, not two.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) To lead absolute beginners in gently:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1551" -->
<a id="c1551"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before reading a command while the turn count is 1, say &quot;(This is your chance to say what the protagonist should do next. After the '&gt;', try typing 'take inventory'.)&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(b) The following responds politely but firmly if the player tries to type &quot;please look&quot;, say, instead of just &quot;look&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1552" -->
<a id="c1552"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('After reading a command:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command includes [=0x0022=]please[=0x0022=]:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Please do not say please.[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]reject the player[=0x0027=]s command.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Please do not say please.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;reject the player's command.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To explain. Fragments of what the player has typed are called snippets: &quot;the player's command&quot; is the entire thing. We can test if a snippet matches a given pattern like so:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn264" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn264"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> matches </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetmatches -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet exactly matches the specification. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1553" -->
<a id="c1553"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command matches &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true if the command is ROOM 101, but not if it's EXPLORE ROOM 7.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn265" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn265"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> does not match </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetdoesnotmatch -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet does not exactly match the specification.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn266" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn266"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> includes </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetincludes -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet includes words matching the specification, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1554" -->
<a id="c1554"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command includes &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true if the command is ROOM 101, EXPLORE ROOM 7, or ROOM 22 AHOY, but not if it's VISIT ROOM GAMMA 7.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn267" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn267"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> does not include </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetdoesnotinclude -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet does not include any run of words which matches the specification.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Lastly, we took drastic action with another new phrase:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn268" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn268"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>reject the player's command</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_rejectcommand -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity. It tells Inform not to bother analysing the text further, but to go back to the keyboard. (No time passes; no turn elapses; nothing happens in the simulated world.)</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>(c) An improved version takes commands like &quot;please drop the coin&quot; and strips &quot;please&quot; from them, but then allows them to proceed normally:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1555" -->
<a id="c1555"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('After reading a command:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command includes [=0x0022=]please[=0x0022=]:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=](Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]cut the matched text.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;(Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Matched text&quot; is a snippet containing the words which matched against the pattern in the most recent &quot;includes&quot; condition, so in this case it contains just the single word &quot;please&quot;. Two phrases allow snippets to be altered:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn269" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn269"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>replace </b>(snippet)<b> with </b>(text)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_replacesnippet -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the snippet of command, usually the &quot;matched text&quot; found immediately before, with the given text. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1556" -->
<a id="c1556"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command includes &quot;room [number]&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the matched text with &quot;office&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn270" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn270"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>cut </b>(snippet)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_cutsnippet -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it removes the snippet of command. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1557" -->
<a id="c1557"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command includes &quot;or else&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Note that &quot;replace&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; can only be used in &quot;after reading a command&quot; rules: not when an action has been chosen and has gone ahead into its rulebooks. Once the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity has finished, the command is final.</p>
<p>(d) To make the word &quot;grab&quot; an abbreviation for &quot;take all&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1558" -->
<a id="c1558"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('After reading a command:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command matches [=0x0022=]grab[=0x0022=], replace the player[=0x0027=]s command with [=0x0022=]take all[=0x0022=].[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command matches &quot;grab&quot;, replace the player's command with &quot;take all&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(&quot;Snippet&quot; is actually a kind of value, so we could say &quot;Ah, you typed '[the player's command]'!&quot; or some such if we liked. But in practice only three snippets are likely to be useful: the two mentioned above, &quot;player's command&quot; and &quot;matched text&quot;, and the &quot;topic understood&quot;, used when matching the &quot;[text]&quot; token in command grammar.)</p>
<p>(e) Finally, we can make still more detailed alterations to the text of the command using the techniques presented in the Advanced Text chapter. For instance:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn271" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn271"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>change the text of the player's command to </b>(text)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_changecommand -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the current command text entirely. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1559" -->
<a id="c1559"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let T be &quot;[the player's command]&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the regular expression &quot;\p&quot; in T with &quot;&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;change the text of the player's command to T.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This converts the player's command to text, which is then manipulated by searching for any punctuation mark and replacing it with blank text (that is, deleted), and then put back again as the new command.</p>

<p>A complication arises because we reach the 9-character limit: Inform truncates the names of objects to nine characters before trying to understand them. To make matters worse, the hyphen (and other punctuation marks) count as two letters. So both north-northwest and north-northeast will get truncated to &quot;north-no&quot;, and be indistinguishable when the player types them.</p>
<p>When we are compiling for Glulx, the limit is easily changed with a single line, setting the constant called DICT_WORD_SIZE. For instance, if we wanted to raise the limit to 15, we would simply write &quot;Use DICT_WORD_SIZE of 15.&quot;</p>
<p>If we're compiling to the Z-machine, however, we'll have to resort to some manipulation of the player's command. The general solution is that when the player's name for an object is going to have to be longer than we can correctly read, we can substitute an unambiguous abbreviation for the thing the player typed. In this case, it will be simplest and most efficient always to condense the player's direction names to single letters, thus:</p>

<p>In practice, this is going to be overkill for almost all games: most players already find eight compass directions plus up and down to be enough (or more than enough) to keep track of. But the option exists, in case there is a compelling reason to use it.</p>
<p>(Note also that we are allowed to use multi-word direction names, so we could  have called the directions &quot;north by northwest&quot;, &quot;north by northeast&quot;, and so on. This example deliberately takes the hard way in order to show how to resolve the nine-character problem.)</p>
