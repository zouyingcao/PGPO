<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.5. Dice and Playing Cards</p>
<p>Most toys are single things, and no harder to create than any other small items, but games often require a multitude of tokens to be combined, and this can be logistically tricky.</p>
<p>The classic example is a pack of playing cards, where the player must individually control 52 items but without fussy commands or verbose text being printed back. <span class="boldface">Jokers Wild</span> provides a simple &quot;one card at a time&quot; approach; <span class="boldface">Tilt 1</span> is more sophisticated, with 52 independently accessible cards; <span class="boldface">Tilt 2</span> can further judge the value of a selection of cards - the ranking of a poker hand.</p>
<p>Drawing cards from a shuffled pack is only one source of randomness. Games of chance also involve items drawn from a bag: <span class="boldface">Wonka's Revenge</span> provides just such a lottery. More often, dice are thrown. A single die is easy enough:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23727" -->
<a id="c23727"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The die is carried by the player. After dropping the die: say &quot;It lands with [a random number from 1 to 6] uppermost.&quot; Understand &quot;roll [something]&quot; as dropping.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Quick, but not very good. Most dice games involve rolling more than one die at a time, to get a more interesting distribution of outcomes: they may also involve special rules applying to doubles, for instance. See <span class="boldface">Do Pass Go</span>.</p>

<p>In our previous implementations of playing cards, we've gotten as far as creating decks of individual cards that the player can draw and discard. But in a poker game, one doesn't just have a collection of cards: one has a hand of a specific kind.</p>
<p>Here we take on the job of writing an inventory listing for a poker hand that will reflect the real value of what the player has drawn. To do this, we create a rulebook to sort and assess the cards in the player's hand; its possible return values are limited to the kinds of poker hands that exist, from &quot;high card&quot; to &quot;royal flush&quot;.</p>
<p>The first three sections, creating the deck of cards and the means to parse their names, are identical to those we've already seen in Tilt 1; new material begins at section 4.</p>
<p>For the purposes of demonstration, we're simulating something akin to five-card draw without wilds; stud or hold-em variations would add some other complexities.</p>

The hand-ranking rules have outcomes royal flush, straight flush, four of a kind, full house, flush, straight, three of a kind, two pairs, pair, high card.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the flushness.[=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rulebook has a truth state called the straightness.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the pair count.[=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the triple count.[=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rulebook has a number called the quadruple count.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player[=0x0027=]s hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on [=0x0022=]Looking at containment by hand[=0x0022=] in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player[=0x0027=]s hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player[=0x0027=]s hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]A card can be sorted or unsorted. A card is usually unsorted.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Definition: a card is high if its rank is 11 or more.[=0x000A=]Definition: a card is low if its rank is 4 or less.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]A hand-ranking rule (this is the initial sort rule):[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]now every card is unsorted;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]while the player carries an unsorted card:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]let item be the lowest unsorted card held by the player;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]move item to the player;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]now the item is sorted;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if sort-debugging is true, say [=0x0022=]-- after initial sort: [list hand][=0x0022=].[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we[=0x0027=]ll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it[=0x0027=]s on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems.

We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand). We also want to mark any grouped cards so that we can move them to the front of the player[=0x0027=]s hand when we take inventory.][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]A card can be quadrupled, tripled, paired or uncombined.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Test rank is a number that varies.

<p>The ranking of poker hands traditionally depends on three features: 1) whether all the cards are of the same suit (flush); 2) whether the cards constitute a numerical run of ranks (straight); and 3) how many cards or sets of cards are of matching rank (pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind). Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c24603" -->
<a id="c24603"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player's hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on &quot;Looking at containment by hand&quot; in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player's hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player's hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.</p>

<p>This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we'll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it's on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems. In normal play, however, this will be off.</p>

<p>And finally, we need to identify any groups of cards of the same rank. We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand).

<p>Next we tweak our sorting to reflect the make-up of the hand. There are two reasons why this might differ from the straight highest-to-lowest sort we did earlier:</p>

<p>In our previous implementations of playing cards, we've gotten as far as creating decks of individual cards that the player can draw and discard. But in a poker game, one doesn't just have a collection of cards: one has a hand of a specific kind.</p>
<p>Here we take on the job of writing an inventory listing for a poker hand that will reflect the real value of what the player has drawn. To do this, we create a rulebook to sort and assess the cards in the player's hand; its possible return values are limited to the kinds of poker hands that exist, from &quot;high card&quot; to &quot;royal flush&quot;.</p>
<p>The first three sections, creating the deck of cards and the means to parse their names, are identical to those we've already seen in Tilt 1; new material begins at section 4.</p>
<p>For the purposes of demonstration, we're simulating something akin to five-card draw without wilds; stud or hold-em variations would add some other complexities.</p>

Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The hand-ranking rules is a rulebook.

It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on [=0x0022=]Looking at containment by hand[=0x0022=] in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player[=0x0027=]s hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player[=0x0027=]s hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]A card can be sorted or unsorted.

<p>The ranking of poker hands traditionally depends on three features: 1) whether all the cards are of the same suit (flush); 2) whether the cards constitute a numerical run of ranks (straight); and 3) how many cards or sets of cards are of matching rank (pairs, three of a kind, and four of a kind). Here we will start by assessing our hand to determine these qualities:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For convenience in identifying hand features, and for elegance when we print the hand-listing, we start by sorting the cards in the player's hand so that the high-ranked cards are listed first. It is rare that we want to concern ourselves with this, but as we saw in the section on &quot;Looking at containment by hand&quot; in the chapter on Change, Inform keeps an ordered list of the items inside any given container; so it does order the objects in the player's hand, and the ordering depends on which things were added to the hand most recently. By moving something to the player's hand again (even if it was already there), we change this ordering, and wind up with a sorted hand.</p>

<p>This last printing instruction is there for diagnostic purposes: later we'll add a testing command to turn debugging on and off; when it's on, the game will print out its card list at various stages in sorting, to help us trouble-shoot any problems. In normal play, however, this will be off.</p>
<p>Next up, a check to see whether the player has a flush:</p>

<p>And finally, we need to identify any groups of cards of the same rank. We want to know how many groups there are and how large each group is (though in practice there can only be one group of three or four in a standard-sized poker hand). We also want to mark any grouped cards so that we can move them to the front of the player's hand when we take inventory.</p>

<p>Next we tweak our sorting to reflect the make-up of the hand. There are two reasons why this might differ from the straight highest-to-lowest sort we did earlier:</p>
<p>1) we want to list aces as high unless they are serving as the bottom of a low straight, in which case they should appear last;</p>
<p>2) we want combinations to appear at the front of the list, sorted from highest value to lowest value: larger combinations first, then smaller combinations, and combinations of equal size sorted by rank.</p>

<p>The somewhat rough-and-ready principle of this table is that we will overwrite the cards in the player's hand by resetting their ranks and suits; every five rows of the table represent a new poker hand for the game to attempt to sort and identify. These include one example of each of the major kinds of poker hand, plus a couple of variations involving aces which test the special sorting rules.</p>
