<p class="sectionheading">ยง5.5. Text with lists</p>
<p>We often want running text to include lists of items.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn17" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn17"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_listof -->

<p>This text substitution produces a list, in sentence form, of everything matching the description. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c315" -->
<a id="c315"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Mr Darcy glares proudly at you. He is wearing [list of things worn by Darcy] and carrying [list of things carried by Darcy].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And, if this were from a dramatisation of the novel by Miss Fielding rather than Miss Austen, we might find:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c316" -->
<a id="c316"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Darcy glares proudly at you. He is wearing a pair of Newcastle United boxer shorts and carrying a self-help book.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If the description matches nothing - for instance, if Darcy has empty hands - then &quot;nothing&quot; is printed.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>As with all lists in Inform, the serial comma is only used if the &quot;Use serial comma.&quot; option is in force. So by default we would get &quot;a fishing pole, a hook and a sinker&quot;, rather than &quot;a fishing pole, a hook, and a sinker&quot;.</p>
<p>We then need variations to add indefinite or definite articles, and to capitalise the first item. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c317" -->
<a id="c317"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Mr Darcy impatiently bundles [the list of things carried by Darcy] into your hands and stomps out of the room.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>might result in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c318" -->
<a id="c318"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mr Darcy impatiently bundles the self-help book and the Christmas card into your hands and stomps out of the room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START PHRASE "defn18" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn18"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[a list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_alistof -->

<p>This text substitution produces a list, in sentence form, of everything matching the description. Each item is prefaced by its indefinite article. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c319" -->
<a id="c319"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a maritime bill of lading, some hemp rope and Falconer's Naval Dictionary
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn19" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn19"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[A list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_Alistof -->

<p>This text substitution produces a list, in sentence form, of everything matching the description. Each item is prefaced by its indefinite article, and the first is capitalised, so that it can be used at the beginning of a sentence. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c320" -->
<a id="c320"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A maritime bill of lading, some hemp rope and Falconer's Naval Dictionary
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn20" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn20"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[the list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_thelistof -->

<p>This text substitution produces a list, in sentence form, of everything matching the description. Each item is prefaced by its definite article. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c321" -->
<a id="c321"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the maritime bill of lading, the hemp rope and Falconer's Naval Dictionary
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn21" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn21"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[The list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_Thelistof -->

<p>This text substitution produces a list, in sentence form, of everything matching the description. Each item is prefaced by its definite article, and the first is capitalised, so that it can be used at the beginning of a sentence. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c322" -->
<a id="c322"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The maritime bill of lading, the hemp rope and Falconer's Naval Dictionary
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>So much for articles. A more insidious problem comes with something like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c323" -->
<a id="c323"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;The places you can go are [list of rooms].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The trouble is that the list may end up either singular or plural. We might be expecting something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c324" -->
<a id="c324"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The places you can go are Old Bailey, Bridget's Flat and TV Centre.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But if there is only one room, then the result might be:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c325" -->
<a id="c325"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The places you can go are Bridget's Flat.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which is wrong. We can get around this with careful wording and a slightly different substitution:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c326" -->
<a id="c326"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Nearby [is-are list of rooms].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START PHRASE "defn22" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn22"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[is-are list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_islistof -->

<p>This text substitution produces a list, in sentence form, of everything matching the description. The whole list starts with &quot;is&quot; (if there's one item or none) or &quot;are&quot; (more than one). Examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c327" -->
<a id="c327"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />are maritime bill of lading, hemp rope and Falconer's Naval Dictionary
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn23" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn23"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[is-are a list of </b>(description of objects)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of phs_isalistof -->
