<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.4. Standard tokens of grammar</p>
<p>We have already seen &quot;[something]&quot; and &quot;[someone]&quot;, which are standard examples of &quot;tokens of grammar&quot; - patterns matched by suitable named things. There are several other standard tokens, provided not so much from necessity but to allow the story parser to be more graceful and responsive. &quot;[someone]&quot; matches the same possibilities as &quot;[a person]&quot; would, but the parser handles it a little better in cases of failure. These special tokens are best explained by looking at some of the examples in the standard grammar, which can be browsed in the Index of any story.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1329" -->
<a id="c1329"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;wear [something preferably held]&quot; as wearing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here we expect that the named item will be one that is held by the player, and the parser will use this to resolve ambiguities between names of things carried and not carried. (If the action is one which positively requires that its noun be something carried, a command matching this token against something not carried will generate an automatic attempt to take it.)</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1330" -->
<a id="c1330"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;take [things]&quot; as taking.
<br />Understand &quot;drop [things preferably held]&quot; as dropping.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;[things]&quot; is like &quot;[something]&quot; but allows a list of items, or a vague plural like &quot;all&quot;, to be typed. The result will be a sequence of actions, one for each item thus described. &quot;[things preferably held]&quot; is the analogous token for &quot;[something preferably held]&quot;.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1331" -->
<a id="c1331"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;take [things inside] from [something]&quot; as removing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;[things inside]&quot; matches only what is inside the second-named thing, and ensures that (for instance) the command &quot;take all from box&quot; does not also try to take the box.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1332" -->
<a id="c1332"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;put [other things] in/inside/into [something]&quot; as inserting it into.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Similarly, &quot;[other things]&quot; will allow anything except the second-named thing. (Like &quot;[things inside]&quot; it is really only needed for handling containers.)</p>
<p>Finally there is &quot;[any things]&quot;, which should be used only with care. This is like &quot;[things]&quot; but with no restriction at all on where the item comes from: it might be invisible, or from a different room, or out of play altogether. If we use this, we had better remember that it would match ALL, with quite extravagant consequences.</p>
