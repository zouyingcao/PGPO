<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.6. Looking Under and Hiding</p>
<p>Finding hidden objects is a classic puzzle in IF. <span class="boldface">Beachfront</span> provides the most basic example, an object that becomes visible only when we have searched the papers on a cluttered desk. <span class="boldface">Beneath the Surface</span> takes this further, giving all large furnishings the ability to conceal items, and allowing the player to put things underneath other things, as well as find them. <span class="boldface">Flashlight</span> adds an extra twist to the puzzle by requiring that the player have a flashlight to shine under a bulky object in order to find what lies underneath.</p>
<p>Looking inside an object is generally handled by the searching action, and we could extend that to allow the player to search multiple or complex objects. <span class="boldface">Matreshka</span> turns the puzzle on its head by allowing the player to search a whole room systematically with only a single command.</p>
