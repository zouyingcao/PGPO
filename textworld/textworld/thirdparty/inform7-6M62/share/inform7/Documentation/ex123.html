<p class="sectionheading">§15.2. Numbers and real numbers</p>
<p>Inform uses two different kinds of numerical quantity: &quot;number&quot; and &quot;real number&quot;. Neither is better than the other: they're different approaches, each good for a different purpose.</p>
<p>What Inform calls a &quot;number&quot; is a whole number, positive, negative or zero. The range of numbers we can hold is not unlimited - if the format Setting for a project is the Z-machine, then we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1104" -->
<a id="c1104"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
-32768, -32767, ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 32767
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and if it is set to Glulx, then we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1105" -->
<a id="c1105"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
-2147483648, -2147483647, ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 2147483647
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Numbers from zero to twelve may be written out, but larger ones must be written as numerals. So &quot;twelve&quot; or &quot;12&quot;, but &quot;13&quot; only.</p>
<p>If we're using Glulx, Inform also has &quot;real numbers&quot; such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1106" -->
<a id="c1106"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
2.1718, 4.0, -1633.9
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which are not restricted to whole numbers, but which are stored only approximately: only about six to nine decimal digits can be relied on. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1107" -->
<a id="c1107"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
showme 1.2345654321;
<br />showme 1.2345667890;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1108" -->
<a id="c1108"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
real number: 1.23457
<br />real number: 1.23457
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because these two numbers are so close together that Inform can't tell them apart. But we do also get the ability to represent enormously large or small quantities, and to help with that, Inform can read and write &quot;scientific notation&quot;. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1109" -->
<a id="c1109"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let Avogadro's number be 6.022141 x 10^23;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is equivalent to typing</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1110" -->
<a id="c1110"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let Avogadro's number be 602214100000000000000000.0;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;x 10^23&quot; part tells Inform that the decimal point belongs 23 places to the left of where it's written. (In scientific papers, the 23 would be printed as a superscript -- it's 10 to the power 23 -- but that's not convenient to type in to the source text, so we use the &quot;^&quot; symbol to indicate superscript.) The range we can hold is roughly:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1111" -->
<a id="c1111"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
1.18 x 10^−38 to 3.4 x 10^38
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It's hard to convey just how enormously different these two numbers are: if we used them to measure widths in meters, one would be a hundred trillion trillion times smaller than an atom, the other a billion times larger than the entire visible universe. Scientific notation is the ultimate adjustable spanner.</p>
<p>Inform also allows the two most famous real numbers in mathematics to be given by their names:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1112" -->
<a id="c1112"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
pi
<br />e
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which are close to 3.14159265 and 2.7182818 respectively. (Lower case letters must be used: these can't be written &quot;Pi&quot; or &quot;E&quot;.  Euler's constant gamma, always in the bronze medal position, will have to be written out longhand as 0.5772156649.)</p>
<p>Most computer programming languages traditionally write floating-point numbers using the E notation, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1113" -->
<a id="c1113"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
6.022141E+23;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform will follow suit if the use option &quot;Use engineering notation.&quot; is set, but by default it isn't.</p>

<p>This much is enough to let us dial telephone numbers and have Inform report that we've done so; it doesn't actually provide a telephone system such that we could reach and converse with other characters (but see the other telephone examples in the recipe book for more on how one might do that).</p>
<p>We'll set up a little political espionage scenario from which our player can make calls:</p>

<p>Now we borrow some techniques from the Understanding chapter to set up dialing actions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7665" -->
<a id="c7665"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;dial [phone number] on [telephone]&quot; as dialing it on. Understand &quot;dial [phone number] on [something]&quot; as dialing it on.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7666" -->
<a id="c7666"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;phone&quot; or &quot;telephone&quot; or &quot;call&quot; as &quot;dial&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7667" -->
<a id="c7667"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;call [text]&quot; or &quot;phone [text]&quot; or &quot;dial [text]&quot; or &quot;telephone [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;That's not a number you know.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7668" -->
<a id="c7668"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7669" -->

Report dialing it on:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You dial [the phone number understood].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This much is enough to let us dial telephone numbers and have Inform report that we've done so; it doesn't actually provide a telephone system such that we could reach and converse with other characters (but see the other telephone examples in the recipe book for more on how one might do that).</p>
<p>We'll set up a little political espionage scenario from which our player can make calls:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7670" -->
<a id="c7670"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Senator's Junior Suite is a room. &quot;The Senator appears, unfortunately, to have very precise habits: little in the room has been moved from its usual place; the trash can is empty; the bed has been remade[if the blue paper is unexamined]. There may in fact be nothing to find here[end if].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7671" -->
<a id="c7671"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7672" -->
<a id="c7672"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is wearing a housekeeping uniform and a brunette wig. The player carries a telephone called a Nokia.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Borrowing again from the chapter on Understanding, we might arrange things so that the player knows and can call a few standard numbers with such syntax as CALL HOME:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7673" -->
<a id="c7673"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;home&quot; as 555-9200.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And what if we'd like to have the player learn some phone numbers during the game?</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7674" -->
<a id="c7674"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing can be examined or unexamined. Carry out examining something: now the noun is examined.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7675" -->
<a id="c7675"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;Stephen&quot; as 555-2513 when the blue paper is examined.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This will understand CALL STEPHEN once the paper is examined; before that, the player will just get the &quot;That's not a number you know&quot; response that Inform uses for all attempts to call unknown names.</p>
<p>We'd better plant this paper for the player to find:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c7676" -->
<a id="c7676"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The blue paper is in the drawer. The description of the blue paper is &quot;It reads: 'Call Stephen - 555-2513'.&quot;

<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c7678" -->
