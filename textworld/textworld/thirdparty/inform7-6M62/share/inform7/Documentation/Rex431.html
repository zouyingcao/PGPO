<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.10. Character Emotion</p>
<p>In a complex story, characters may evolve strong feelings about the player. Often we want to hint at the character's feelings through gesture and tone of voice - little things woven into dialogue and action sequences that might otherwise be unchanged. <span class="boldface">Ferragamo Again</span> demonstrates creating phrases to give all our characters different ways to express their irritation at the player.</p>
<p>Then again, sometimes a discussion might produce quite spectacular results if a character is in the wrong mood. <span class="boldface">Being Peter</span> shows the bare bones of an implementation in which a character's attitude rulebook is consulted to determine what her response will be - allowing for arbitrarily complicated outcomes.</p>
