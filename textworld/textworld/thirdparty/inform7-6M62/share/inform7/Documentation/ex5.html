<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.9. Which and who</p>
<p>A description can not only talk about things in terms of themselves, but also in terms of their relationships to the rest of the world. For instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c410" -->
<a id="c410"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
an open container on the table
<br />a woman inside a lighted room
<br />an animal carried by a man
<br />a woman taller than Mark
<br />something worn by somebody
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are all valid descriptions. These are really abbreviations, having missed out the words &quot;which is&quot; or &quot;who is&quot;, as appropriate:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c411" -->
<a id="c411"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
an open container which is on the table
<br />a woman who is inside a lighted room
<br />an animal which is carried by a man
<br />a woman who is taller than Mark
<br />something which is worn by somebody
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and indeed those are also valid descriptions. The other sentence verbs can all be used here, too. So for instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c412" -->
<a id="c412"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a man who does not wear anything
<br />something which supports something
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And sometimes we should spell out &quot;who is&quot; regardless:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c413" -->
<a id="c413"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a man who is not Sherlock Holmes
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Since these clauses can be attached to the end of any valid description, descriptions can grow longer still:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c414" -->
<a id="c414"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
something worn by a woman who is in a dark room
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Pedants who flinch when &quot;which&quot; is used to introduce a restrictive clause are welcome to use &quot;that&quot; instead.</p>

<p>One of the advantages of descriptions is that we can use them to pick an item randomly from a specified category. (For more on this possibility, see the Change chapter sections on randomness.)</p>
