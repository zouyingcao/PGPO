<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> When looking in darkness.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> To print &quot;It is pitch dark, and you can't see a thing.&quot;</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) A simple variation of wording:</p>

<a id="c1509"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<p>(b) More stylishly,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1510" -->
<a id="c1510"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Note that this activity does not come in different forms for different dark rooms: the wording is fixed at &quot;printing the description of a dark room&quot;, and we are not allowed to substitute particular dark rooms or assign a &quot;(called ...)&quot; onto the mention of the dark room.)</p>
