<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.6. Ending The Story</p>
<p>Play can end in many ways, at the writer's discretion:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23745" -->
<a id="c23745"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
end the story;
<br />end the story finally;
<br />end the story saying &quot;You have reached an impasse, a stalemate&quot;;
<br />end the story finally saying &quot;You have succeeded.&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The phrase &quot;end the story&quot; by itself will finish play, printing &quot;*** The End ***&quot;. Using one of the phrases with &quot;saying...&quot; allows us to specify some other text with which to conclude. Including &quot;finally&quot; means that the player has earned access to AMUSING text and other notes, if any of these are provided.</p>
<p>We can eliminate the asterisked headline entirely by removing the rule that prints it, thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23746" -->
<a id="c23746"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print obituary headline rule is not listed in any rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The next step is to print the player's score and, if applicable, the rank he achieved. By default a story doesn't feature scoring, but the following use option will incorporate it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23747" -->
<a id="c23747"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use scoring.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Then, if we want to allow a score but alter the way it is reported, we may remove or modify the print final score rule, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23748" -->
<a id="c23748"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The print final score rule is not listed in any rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or perhaps something like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23749" -->
<a id="c23749"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The chatty final score rule is listed instead of the print final score rule in for printing the player's obituary.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23750" -->
<a id="c23750"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
This is the chatty final score rule: say &quot;Wow, you achieved a whole [score in words] point[s] out of a possible [maximum score in words]! I'm very proud of you. This was a triumph. I'm being so sincere right now.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>What happens next is normally that the player is invited to RESTART, RESTORE (from a saved story), QUIT or UNDO the last command. The presence of the question can somewhat undercut a tragedy, and <span class="boldface">Battle of Ridgefield</span> shows another way to go out.</p>
<p>If we do leave the question in, the text is formed by the Table of Final Question Options, which by default looks like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23751" -->
<a id="c23751"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</table><blockquote><p>
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Because this is a table, we may alter the behavior by changing entries or continuing the table. <span class="boldface">Finality</span> shows how we might take out the option to UNDO the last command, for instance.</p>
<p>Using an ending phrase that includes &quot;finally&quot; tells Inform to include the options that are marked &quot;only if victorious&quot;. One common use is to let the player read some special bit of additional text, perhaps describing easter eggs he might have missed in the story or presenting some authorial notes. <span class="boldface">Xerxes</span> demonstrates a simple AMUSING command to read final information, while <span class="boldface">Jamaica 1688</span> shows how to add completely new elements to the list of options.</p>
<p>Old-school adventures expected their adventurers to die early and die often. <span class="boldface">Labyrinth of Ghosts</span> shows how the residue of such past attempts can be preserved into subsequent attempts, using an external file. <span class="boldface">Big Sky Country</span> shows how a player can be resurrected by, let us say, some beneficent god, so that a player can even die more than once in the same attempt.</p>
