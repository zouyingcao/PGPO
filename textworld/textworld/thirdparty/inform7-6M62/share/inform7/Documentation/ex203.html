<p>A &quot;device&quot; is another of the standard kinds of thing, and should be used for anything which can be switched on or off: a light switch, say, or a slide projector. Devices are generally machines, clockwork or electrical. A device is always either &quot;switched on&quot; or &quot;switched off&quot;, but is switched off unless we specify otherwise.</p>
<p>That makes three kinds of thing which will likely change their appearance according to which of their two possible states they are in: doors and containers, which can be open or closed; and devices, which can be switched on or switched off. We would like to produce text accordingly, and we can do this using Inform's ability to make (almost) any piece of text change with circumstances. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c137" -->
<a id="c137"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The coffin is an openable container in the Undertomb. &quot;[if open]The lid of a plank coffin yawns open.[otherwise]A plank coffin lies upon the dirt floor of the Tomb.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We could use a similar trick to make the appearance of a device change &quot;if switched on&quot;. There will be much more about text substitutions, as instructions in square brackets like these are called, in later chapters.</p>

<p>Inform already has the idea of light and darkness built in; we will see more about this later, and the Phrasebook (in the Index tab) also contains a list of all the adjectives (lighted, dark, etc) which are important to use here.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Index, the Actions tab contains a list of all the grammar that can be used to activate a given command: for instance, the switching action responds to &quot;switch [something]&quot; or &quot;turn on [something]&quot;. In this case, we may want to give the player an extra option or two. It would be pretty natural for a player to try &gt;FLIP SWITCH, so let's add that in:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11409" -->
<a id="c11409"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;flip [something switched off]&quot; as switching on. Understand &quot;flip [something switched on]&quot; as switching off. Understand &quot;flip [something]&quot; as switching on.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The nuances of this will be explored in the chapter on Understanding. What is useful to know here is that we have taught Inform to understand that &gt;FLIP LIGHT SWITCH means to turn it on when the switch is already off; if the switch is already on, FLIP SWITCH means to turn the switch off. Depending on the kind of device we are modeling (button? lever? dial?), we might want to write similar lines for commands such as PUSH, PRESS, PULL, TURN, and so on.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to deal with a special case. In general, the player cannot interact with other things in a dark room because he can't see them, but if we adhered strictly to this it would be impossible for him to find the light switch to turn it back on. So we need something from the chapter on Activities to change this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11410" -->
<a id="c11410"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After deciding the scope of the player when the location is the Terrifying Basement:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;place the light switch in scope.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11411" -->
<a id="c11411"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Upstairs is above the Terrifying Basement.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c11412" -->
<a id="c11412"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test me with &quot;turn off light / look / flip light switch&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
