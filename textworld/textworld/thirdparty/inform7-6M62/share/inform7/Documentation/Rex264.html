<p>The &quot;device&quot; kind provides for the simplest form of machine: one which is, at any given moment, switched on or switched off. Inform looks after this state, but leaves it to us to make the machine actually do something:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23731" -->
<a id="c23731"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The air-conditioning unit is a device in the Florist's Shop. The air-conditioning is fixed in place and switched on.

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the air-conditioning is switched off, say &quot;You worry about the cut flowers in this jungle-hot air.&quot;;

<p>One primary dictionary definition for a machine is &quot;an apparatus using or applying mechanical power and having several parts&quot;, and we often use the &quot;part of&quot; relationship to build machinery. <span class="boldface">Control Center</span> provides a neat way to display the component parts of a machine to the player who examines it.</p>
<p>One component almost always part of an electrical machine is the (literal) switch, lever or button to control whether it is switched on or off. In <span class="boldface">Model Shop</span> just such an on/off button is automatically made part of every device.</p>
<p>While an electrical device has only two states, a mechanical machine might have many, and for these the best approach is to define a kind of value naming the possibilities: see <span class="boldface">Signs and Portents</span>, where the states are the possible destinations pointed towards.</p>
<p>Perhaps stretching the definition of &quot;machine&quot;, <span class="boldface">What Makes You Tick</span> demonstrates a fishing pole which the player can put together from several pieces.</p>
