<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> When an item is listed in the miscellaneous collection of items present in a room (the ones which do not deserve their own paragraphs): this is normally the last paragraph of a room description.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> A bracketed piece of extra information is added for certain items such as containers:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1496" -->
<a id="c1496"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can also see Po and a cage (empty) here.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot; (empty)&quot; (note initial space) was added by this activity. (Note that this activity is not responsible for describing further items visible because of the item in question: that is, it does not print the text such as &quot;(in which is a notepad)&quot; which would appear if there were contents. If we want to remove such text, we should use &quot;omit contents in listing&quot;: see the activity &quot;for printing the name of something&quot;.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) To get rid of such addenda entirely, try:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1497" -->
<a id="c1497"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing room description details: stop.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(b) To add a new form of addendum:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1498" -->
<a id="c1498"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing room description details of a person:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot; (at last, someone to talk to)&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If both examples (a) and (b) are in place at once, we might now read:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1499" -->
<a id="c1499"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
