<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.14. Adjacent rooms and routes through the map</p>
<p>Another useful adjective built into Inform is &quot;adjacent&quot;. Two rooms are said to be adjacent if there is a map connection between them which does not pass through some barrier such as a door. This is easily tested:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c439" -->
<a id="c439"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the Hallway is adjacent to the Study ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We usually want to know about the places adjacent to the current scene of the action, so that is what the adjective &quot;adjacent&quot; means when applied to rooms. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c440" -->
<a id="c440"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if somebody is in an adjacent room, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As with the case of &quot;visible&quot;, the adjective is a cut-down version of the more general relationship. This often happens: &quot;worn&quot; and &quot;carried&quot;, for instance, imply &quot;by the player&quot; unless something else is specified.</p>
<p>If we want to ask a more direct question, we can obtain specific map connections as follows. (Recall that every map connection leads either to a door, to a room, or to nothing.) If we know which direction we want to look in, then the easiest thing is to use its relation - every direction in the map, say &quot;north&quot;, has its own relation, say &quot;mapped north of&quot;. So:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c441" -->
<a id="c441"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the Ballroom is mapped north of the Hallway, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Alternatively, and particularly if the direction is not a constant,</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn60" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn60"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>room </b>(direction)<b> from</b>/of<b> </b>(room)<b> ... room</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_roomdirof -->

<p>This phrase produces the room which the given map direction leads to, or the special value &quot;nothing&quot; if it leads nowhere. If it leads to a door, the result is the room through that door. Examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c442" -->
<a id="c442"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;You look north into [the room north from the Garden].&quot;
<br />if the room north from the Garden is nothing, say &quot;The grass leads nowhere.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn61" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn61"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>door </b>(direction)<b> from</b>/of<b> </b>(room)<b> ... door</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_doordirof -->

<p>This phrase produces the door which the given map direction leads to, or the special value &quot;nothing&quot; if it leads nowhere or to a room. Examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c443" -->
<a id="c443"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
let the barrier be the door north from the Garden;
<br />if the barrier is a door, say &quot;Well, [the barrier] is in the way.&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn62" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn62"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>room-or-door </b>(direction)<b> from</b>/of<b> </b>(room)<b> ... object</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_roomordoor -->

<p>This phrase produces the object which the given map direction leads to, which will always be either a room, a door or the special value &quot;nothing&quot;. The phrase is used mainly by the Standard Rules, for technical reasons, and usually it's better to use &quot;room ... from ...&quot; or &quot;door ... from ...&quot; instead.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The map can be a great sprawling mass of rooms and doors connected together, and it can be quite hard to find a way through it one step at a time.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn63" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn63"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>best route from </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b> ... object</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_bestroute -->

<p>This phrase produces a direction to take in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms, or produces &quot;nothing&quot; if there is no way through at all. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c444" -->
<a id="c444"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The description of the brass compass is &quot;The dial points quiveringly to [best route from the location to the Lodestone Room].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Best routes are ordinarily forbidden to go through doors, but if the suffix &quot;using doors&quot; is added as an option then any open or openable and unlocked door may be used on the way; and if &quot;using even locked doors&quot; is given, then any door at all will do. Since magnetism is no respecter of property, that seems right here:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c445" -->
<a id="c445"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The description of the brass compass is &quot;The dial points quiveringly to [best route from the location to the Lodestone Room, using even locked doors].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>In practice this simple approach sometimes produces impossible journeys, rather the way Google Maps directions from New York to London would recommend driving down to the docks and then swimming. A more careful approach is to use:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn64" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn64"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>best route from </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b> through </b>(description of objects)<b> ... object</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_bestroutethrough -->

<p>This phrase produces a direction to take in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms which match the given description, or produces &quot;nothing&quot; if there is no way through at all. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c446" -->
<a id="c446"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
best route from the Drawbridge to the Keep through visited rooms
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The condition - in this case, that &quot;visited rooms&quot; must be used - also applies to both ends of the journey, so if either Drawbridge or Keep are unvisited then this is &quot;nothing&quot;. (Similarly, saying something like &quot;...through containers&quot; would mean there is never a route.)</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Lastly, the following phrases can find out how long the journey would be. (They are quite a bit faster than using the &quot;best route...&quot; phrases repeatedly and counting.)</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn65" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn65"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>number of moves from </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b> ... number</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_bestroutelength -->

<p>This phrase produces the number of map connections which must be followed in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms. If A and B are the same, the answer is 0; if there is no route at all, the answer is -1. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c447" -->
<a id="c447"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The description of the proximity gadget is &quot;You are now [number of moves from the location to the Sundial] moves from the Sundial.&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn66" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn66"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>number of moves from </b>(object)<b> to </b>(object)<b> through </b>(description of objects)<b> ... number</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_bestroutethroughlength -->

<p>This phrase produces the number of map connections which must be followed in order to get from A to B by the shortest number of movements between rooms matching the given description. If A and B are the same, the answer is 0; if there is no route at all, or if either A or B fail to match the description themselves, the answer is -1.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Route-finding makes it possible to write quite sophisticated conditions concisely. But these sometimes run slowly, because they call for large amounts of computation. How rapidly Inform can find routes depends on which of two methods it uses. Both have advantages - one is fast but needs large amounts of memory, the other is slow but economical. We can choose between them with one of these two use options:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c448" -->
<a id="c448"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use fast route-finding.
<br />Use slow route-finding.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If neither is specified, &quot;fast&quot; is used where the project uses the Glulx virtual machine (see the Settings panel), and &quot;slow&quot; on the Z-machine, where memory is tighter. Fast route-finding is ideally suited to situations where dozens of characters are constantly route-finding through the map as they meander around in a landscape.</p>
