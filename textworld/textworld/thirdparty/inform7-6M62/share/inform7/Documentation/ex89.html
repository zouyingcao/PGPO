<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.18. The value after and the value before</p>
<p>A point which has come up several times in recent chapters is that enumerated kinds of value have a natural ordering. For example, if we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c830" -->
<a id="c830"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...then we not only have seven possible values, we have put them into a sequence, in order of their naming. We can't perform arithmetic on colours, of course, but we can perform comparisons on them. Thus &quot;red &lt; yellow&quot; is true, while &quot;green &gt;= violet&quot; is not. (More on comparisons in the chapter on Numbers and Equations, which also covers arithmetic.)</p>
<p>It's also sometimes useful to get at the sequence directly. First, the two ends:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn140" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn140"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>first value of </b>(name of kind)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_enumfirst -->

<p>This phrase produces the first-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c831" -->
<a id="c831"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then &quot;first value of colour&quot; is red.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn141" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn141"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>last value of </b>(name of kind)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_enumlast -->

<p>This phrase produces the last-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c832" -->
<a id="c832"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then &quot;last value of colour&quot; is violet.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>And now how to step forward and back:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn142" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn142"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> after </b>(enumerated value)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_enumafter -->

<p>This phrase produces the next-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c833" -->
<a id="c833"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then &quot;colour after orange&quot; is yellow.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn143" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn143"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> before </b>(enumerated value)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_enumbefore -->

<p>This phrase produces the previous-created value of the given kind, which should be an enumeration. Example: if we have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c834" -->
<a id="c834"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and violet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then &quot;colour before blue&quot; is green.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
