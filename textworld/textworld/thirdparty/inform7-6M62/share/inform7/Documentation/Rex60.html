<p>Here is the part that actually determines the preferences. &quot;Does the player mean...&quot; can result in five outcomes: &quot;it is very unlikely&quot;, &quot;it is unlikely&quot;, &quot;it is possible&quot; (the neutral default), &quot;it is likely&quot;, and &quot;it is very likely&quot;. This is discussed in greater detail in the Understanding chapter. Here, we want to discourage references to the player's own nose and encourage references to the nose of Rudolph, so:</p>
