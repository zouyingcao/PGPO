<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.2. Map</p>
<p>A work of IF contains many spectacles and activities, and these must not all present themselves at once, or the player will be overwhelmed. One way to spread them out is in time, by having them available only as a plot develops, but another is to spread them out literally in space. The player has to walk between the Library and the Swimming Pool, and thus bookish and athletic tasks are not both presenting themselves at once. There have been valiant &quot;one-room&quot; IFs, and it forms a respectable sub-genre of the art, but most works of any size need a map.</p>
<p>Inform, following IF conventions, divides the world up into locations called &quot;rooms&quot;, connected together by so-called &quot;map connections&quot; along compass bearings. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23601" -->
<a id="c23601"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Library is east of the Swimming Pool.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The example <span class="boldface">Port Royal 1</span> develops a medium-sized map from such sentences. This develops in <span class="boldface">Port Royal 2</span> to include connections which bend around, allowing the rooms not to lie on an imaginary square grid.</p>
<p>Because it is useful to group rooms together under names describing whole areas, Inform also allows rooms to be placed in &quot;regions&quot;. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23602" -->
<a id="c23602"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Campus Area is a region. The Library and the Swimming Pool are in the Campus Area.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p><span class="boldface">Port Royal 3</span> demonstrates this further. <span class="boldface">A&amp;E</span> shows how regions can be used to write simple rules which regulate access to and from whole areas of the map.</p>
<p>Many old-school IF puzzles involve journeys through the map which are confused, randomised or otherwise frustrated: see <span class="boldface">Bee Chambers</span> for a typical maze, <span class="boldface">Zork II</span> for a randomised connection, <span class="boldface">Prisoner's Dilemma</span> for a change in the map occurring during play. A completely random map takes us away from traditional IF and more towards a different sort of old-school game, the computerised role-playing game with its endless quests through dungeons with randomly generated treasures and monsters. This style of map - building itself one step at a time, as the player explores - can sometimes be useful to provide an illusion of infinite expanse: see <span class="boldface">All Roads Lead To Mars</span>.</p>
<p>While the standard compass directions are conventional in IF, there are times when we may want to replace them without other forms of directional relationship. <span class="boldface">Indirection</span> renames the compass directions to correspond to primary colors, as in Mayan thinking. <span class="boldface">The World of Charles S. Roberts</span> substitutes new ones, instead, introducing a hex-grid map in place of the usual one.</p>
