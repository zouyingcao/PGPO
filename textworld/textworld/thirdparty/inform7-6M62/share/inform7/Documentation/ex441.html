<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.16. New conditions, new adjectives</p>
<p>We can create new conditions by defining a phrase with &quot;to decide whether&quot; (or equivalently &quot;to decide if&quot;):</p>
<!-- START CODE "c820" -->
<a id="c820"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To decide whether danger lurks:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if in darkness, decide yes;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the Control Room has been visited, decide no;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide yes.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If the player is indeed in darkness, the decision is &quot;yes&quot; because the &quot;decide yes&quot; stops the process right there. We can now write, for instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c821" -->
<a id="c821"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if danger lurks, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In fact, &quot;danger lurks&quot; is now a condition as good as any other, and can be used wherever a condition would be given. Rules can apply only &quot;when danger lurks&quot;, for instance.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn137" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn137"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>yes</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>decide yes</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_yes -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in the definition of a phrase to decide whether a condition holds. It ends the decision process immediately and makes the condition true.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn138" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn138"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>no</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>decide no</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_no -->

<p>This phrase can only be used in the definition of a phrase to decide whether a condition holds. It ends the decision process immediately and makes the condition false.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We can also supply definitions of adjectives like this. So far, new adjectives have been defined like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c822" -->
<a id="c822"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('Definition: a supporter is occupied if it is described and something is on it.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> Definition: a supporter is occupied if it is described and something is on it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we want to give a definition which involves more complex logic, we can use a special form allowing us to make arbitrary decisions. In this longer format, the same definition would look like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c823" -->
<a id="c823"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('Definition: a supporter is occupied:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if it is undescribed, decide no;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if something is on it, decide yes;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]decide no.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> Definition: a supporter is occupied:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if it is undescribed, decide no;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if something is on it, decide yes;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;decide no.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here &quot;it&quot; refers to the supporter in question. Note that there are now two colons in this sentence, one after &quot;Definition&quot;, the other after the clause being defined. But that apart, it's a phrase like any other: it must end in &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; just as the &quot;danger lurks&quot; example must. &quot;Decide no&quot; and &quot;decide yes&quot; are needed so often that they can be abbreviated by leaving out &quot;decide&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c824" -->
<a id="c824"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a supporter is occupied:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if it is undescribed, no;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if something is on it, yes;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Suppose we want the game to interpret &quot;GO OUT&quot; as &quot;move towards an outdoors room, or towards a room with more exits than the current room&quot;, while &quot;GO IN&quot; means &quot;move toward a room with fewer exits, or towards an indoors room&quot;.
