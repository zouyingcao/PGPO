<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.18. Randomness</p>
<p>Sometimes we want to introduce random behaviour into play. We usually do this by generating random values, and then acting differently depending on what they are. The following:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c622" -->
<a id="c622"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a random number from 2 to 5
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>produces, as it suggests, a random number drawn from the choices 2, 3, 4 or 5, each of which is equally likely to come up. In fact, this isn't limited to numbers:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn86" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn86"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>a random </b>(name of kind)<b> between </b>(arithmetic value)<b> and </b>(arithmetic value)<b> ... value</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>a random </b>(name of kind)<b> from </b>(arithmetic value)<b> to </b>(arithmetic value)<b> ... value</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>a random </b>(name of kind)<b> between </b>(enumerated value)<b> and </b>(enumerated value)<b> ... value</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>a random </b>(name of kind)<b> from </b>(enumerated value)<b> to </b>(enumerated value)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_randombetween -->

<p>This phrase produces a uniformly random value in the range given. Examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c623" -->
<a id="c623"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a random number from 10 to 99
<br />a random time from 2:31 PM to 2:57 PM
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we make a new kind of value:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c624" -->
<a id="c624"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A cloud pattern is a kind of value. The cloud patterns are cumulus, altocumulus, cumulonimbus, stratus, cirrus, nimbus, nimbostratus.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then we can also take random values from it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c625" -->
<a id="c625"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a random cloud pattern between stratus and nimbus
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which has three possible outcomes, all equally likely.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We can also use random conditions:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn87" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn87"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if a random chance of </b>(number)<b> in </b>(number)<b> succeeds:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_randomchance -->

<p>This condition is true X/Yths of the time, where X and Y are the numbers. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c626" -->
<a id="c626"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if a random chance of 2 in 3 succeeds, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here is a rule which applies only 15% of the time:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c627" -->
<a id="c627"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of waiting when a random chance of 15 in 100 succeeds: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Testing IF which makes random choices can be rather frustrating, because a problem showing up on one attempt may not show up on another. We can get around this by making use of the fact that computers do not actually generate true randomness, but instead make a sequence of apparently random numbers by applying a complicated formula to each one in order to make the next. The starting point is a number called the &quot;seed&quot;, because the next choice grows out of it.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn88" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn88"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>seed the random-number generator with </b>(number)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_seed -->

<p>This phrase changes the seed number as specified. Any random numbers generated after that depend only on the seed. Example: the following sentence will &quot;fix&quot; the process of generating these random numbers so that they are not random at all - the same sequence of random numbers will be produced on each run.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c628" -->
<a id="c628"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins, seed the random-number generator with 1234.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The seed value &quot;1234&quot; can be anything positive; a different sequence of random numbers will be produced for each different seed value. A seed value of 0 restores the RNG to properly random behaviour again.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Alternatively, it's possible the &quot;fix&quot; the RNG by clicking the &quot;Make random outcomes predictable when testing&quot; option on the Settings panel. This makes the behaviour predictable whenever the story is played within Inform, but (unlike the rule above) has no effect on the story file once released.</p>
