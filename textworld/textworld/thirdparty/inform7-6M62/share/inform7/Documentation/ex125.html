<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.5. New activities</p>
<p>Activities are all about influencing the standard mechanisms which Inform uses, so it might at first seem that there is no need to create new activities: but on further reflection, quite a lot of the writing of interactive fiction involves creating new and systematic ways to do things, and as soon as we have a general rule, we will want to have exceptions. Inform therefore allows us to create our own activities, giving us ways to influence the operation of our own mechanisms.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of activity: those which relate to a specific value (usually an object but not necessarily), and those which do not. Here are some examples of activities being created:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1440" -->
<a id="c1440"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Assaying is an activity.
<br />Analysing something is an activity.
<br />Announcing something is an activity on numbers.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform looks for the clue &quot;something&quot; (or &quot;of something&quot;) after the activity's name to see if it will work on a value: so analysing and announcing will do, but assaying won't. If we don't specify a kind, Inform assumes the value will be an object, as if we had written:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1441" -->
<a id="c1441"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Analysing something is an activity on objects.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As always in Inform, the names of activities are themselves values.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1442" -->
<a id="c1442"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;assaying activity&quot; has kind activity on nothing
<br />&quot;analysing activity&quot; has kind activity on objects
<br />&quot;announcing activity&quot; has kind activity on numbers
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Creating an activity is like creating an action: it automatically makes new rulebooks - &quot;before analysing&quot;, &quot;for analysing&quot; and &quot;after analysing&quot; - but they start out empty, so the activity does nothing yet. Just as it does for rulebooks, Inform defines the adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot; for activities to test this state:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1443" -->
<a id="c1443"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the analysing activity is empty, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true only when all three of its rulebooks are empty.</p>
<p>A newly created activity never happens unless we take steps to make it do so. We can make an activity happen at any time by writing phrases like so:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn247" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn247"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>carry out the </b>(activity)<b> activity</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_carryout -->

<p>This phrase carries out the given activity, which must be one not applying to any value. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1444" -->
<a id="c1444"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
carry out the assaying activity;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn248" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn248"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>carry out the </b>(activity on values)<b> activity with </b>(value)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_carryoutwith -->

<p>This phrase carries out the given activity, which must apply to a kind of value matching the one supplied. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1445" -->
<a id="c1445"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
carry out the analysing activity with the pitchblende;
<br />carry out the announcing activity with the score;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>To make the activity do something useful, we need to put a rule into its &quot;for&quot; rulebook:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1446" -->
<a id="c1446"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for announcing a number (called N): say &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, [N].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1447" -->
<a id="c1447"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The last for assaying rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Professionally, you cast an eye around mineral deposits nearby, noticing [list of rocks in the location].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;The last&quot; is a technicality about rulebooks (see the next chapter) which, put briefly, guarantees that this rule comes last among all possible &quot;for assaying&quot; rules. This is good form because the whole point of an activity is to make it easy for further rules to interfere - so we deliberately hang back to last place, giving precedence to anybody else who wants it.</p>
<p>The &quot;for&quot; rulebook is one where rules stop the activity, by default, when they take effect - in the same way that the &quot;instead&quot; rules stop actions by default. If this causes problems, we can use:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn249" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn249"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>continue the activity</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_continueactivity -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in rules in activity rulebooks. It causes the current rule to end, but without result, so that the activity continues rather than stopping as a result of the rule. This is useful for rulebooks (like the &quot;for&quot; rulebook of an activity) where the default is that a rule does stop the activity.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Activities are more useful than they first appear. Every new one provides a context which other activities can observe. We could, for instance, define</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1448" -->
<a id="c1448"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of a rock while assaying: ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>so that during assays more technical names are used.</p>

<p>Suppose we want to add rules so that any time we examine a charred object (and most of our objects can be charred), a line about the charring is appended to the end of the object description. We could use &quot;after examining...&quot;, but perhaps we would prefer for the sentence about the charring not to appear in its own paragraph.</p>
<p>This is an ideal occasion for a new activity. We look at the action index for &quot;examining&quot; to identify the rule that causes the old behavior (in this case, the &quot;standard examining rule&quot;); replace this with a new rule that calls our activity; and write our &quot;printing the description&quot; activity in such a way that it uses an object's description without forcing a paragraph return afterward.</p>
<p>Then we will use &quot;after printing the description&quot; to add our line about charring, and make sure that the paragraph return does occur before the prompt.</p>

<p>This is an ideal occasion for a new activity. We look at the action index for &quot;examining&quot; to identify the rule that causes the old behavior (in this case, the &quot;standard examining rule&quot;); replace this with a new rule that calls our activity; and write our &quot;printing the description&quot; activity in such a way that it uses an object's description without forcing a paragraph return afterward.</p>
<p>Then we will use &quot;after printing the description&quot; to add our line about charring, and make sure that the paragraph return does occur before the prompt.</p>

The Desert Isle is a room. &quot;A pale expanse of sand, here and there developing into hillocks of grass, and a small clump of palms. The water is shallow here, and there are other islands within swimming distance -- or even wading distance, perhaps -- but none of them is any larger than your island, so it doesn't seem worth the trouble of visiting.
