<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.8. Fire</p>
<p>Fire exhibits some of the properties of a gas: it is only vaguely located and tends to spread out, though it passes by touch rather than on the air. It is hazardous to life, through direct contact, heat, and smoke. Better governed, it provides light and warmth. Worse governed, it consumes almost anything it comes into contact with. Here the problem with &quot;debris&quot; is not so much that we need potentially hundreds of new objects to represent broken items: instead, fire could sweep through a work of IF destroying so much that no play is possible any longer. Setting up a problem in which the player must defeat a fully-capable fire is difficult to balance.</p>
<p>As with liquids, it is best to simulate the least amount of fire that the design will allow. <span class="boldface">Bruneseau's Journey</span> provides a single candle which can be lit, or blown out, but where fire can never transfer from the candle's end to anything else - or vice versa: the player's source of fire, with which to light the candle, is discreetly neglected.</p>
<p>In the more realistic <span class="boldface">Thirst 2</span>, a campfire is lit using a tinderbox, so that fire does transfer from one thing (tinder) to another (the campfire): but it is always confined to just these two items, and can be used only for light and warmth.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">The Cow Exonerated</span> provides a class of matches that can light any flammable object, but assumes that burning objects requires only one turn; lighting one thing does not burn another.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">In Fire or in Flood</span> provides a complete simulation of what we might call &quot;wild-fire&quot;: combustion which spreads through arbitrary objects and rooms, destroying all in its path.</p>

<p>Because we've labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual.
