<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.13. Traveling Characters</p>
<p>There are a number of ways we can make characters navigate our map. We might reasonably want them to approach and follow the player (as in <span class="boldface">Van Helsing</span>); or to allow the player to follow characters who have left the room (as in <span class="boldface">Actaeon</span>).</p>
<p>Characters who are less interested in the player will more likely follow their own courses around the available geography, however. A character may move randomly from room to room, as demonstrated in <span class="boldface">Mistress of Animals</span>; he may follow a path that we have specifically written in advance, as <span class="boldface">Odyssey</span> shows; or, most elegantly, he may use the &quot;best route&quot; calculation to find the best possible way to a given target room, as seen in <span class="boldface">Latris Theon</span>.</p>
<p>This final method is arguably the neatest solution to character movement, allowing for characters to act in sophisticated ways; if we incorporate the Locksmith extension, other characters will even unlock and open doors that are in their way. The chief catch is that it should not be used too profligately with large numbers of characters, since on slow machines the processing power required to plan all their travel will make a noticeable difference to the running speed of the story.</p>
<p>All the same, the constraints are not so severe as to preclude having a moderate number of route-finding characters all wandering around at once. This does introduce a new problem, however: movement descriptions can become hard to follow if every turn produces long reams of reports such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23707" -->
<a id="c23707"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Joe enters the room from the south.
<br />Lawrence opens the gate.
<br />Lawrence departs to the west.
<br />Lucy comes in from above.
<br />Ted enters the room from the south.
<br />Bill departs to the west.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p><span class="boldface">Patient Zero</span> tackles this problem by calculating all of the character movement without printing any text; it then combines similar or related events into coherent paragraphs, as in</p>

<p>Finally, we do need to wake Athena up again if she has become passive. The following rule will occur after the movement rule just because of code ordering, though we could make matters more explicit if we needed to:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c27927" -->
<a id="c27927"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn when Athena is passive:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now Athena is active.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c27928" -->
<a id="c27928"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test me with &quot;east / northwest / wait / examine athena / wait&quot;.
