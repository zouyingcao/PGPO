<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.15. Understanding things by their properties</p>
<p>Items are ordinarily understood only by their original given names. For instance, if we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1378" -->
<a id="c1378"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Herb Garden is a china pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the player could refer to this as &quot;pot&quot;, &quot;china pot&quot; or &quot;china&quot;. We can embellish this by adding extra forms:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1379" -->
<a id="c1379"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;chinese pot&quot; or &quot;chinese vase&quot; as the china pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But suppose the pot changes its nature in the course of play? If we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1380" -->
<a id="c1380"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The china pot can be unbroken or broken. The china pot is unbroken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1381" -->
<a id="c1381"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After dropping the china pot:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the china pot is broken;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed name of the pot is &quot;broken pot&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So now the player would reasonably expect to call it &quot;broken pot&quot;, a wording which would have been rejected before. We can achieve this by writing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1382" -->
<a id="c1382"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the unbroken property as describing the pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which allows &quot;unbroken&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; to describe the pot, depending on its state. And, since the player might well use a different adjective but with the same idea in mind, we can even add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1383" -->
<a id="c1383"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;shattered&quot; or &quot;cracked&quot; or &quot;smashed&quot; as broken. Understand &quot;pristine&quot; as unbroken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is something of a toy example, but the feature looks rather more useful when there are more pots than just one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1384" -->
<a id="c1384"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1385" -->
<a id="c1385"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1386" -->
<a id="c1386"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the noun is broken;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpot&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed plural name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpots&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1387" -->
<a id="c1387"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We then have the dialogue:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1388" -->
<a id="c1388"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Herb Garden
<br />You can see ten flowerpots here.
<br />&gt;get two flowerpots
<br />flowerpot: Taken.
<br />flowerpot: Taken.
<br />&gt;drop all
<br />flowerpot: Crack!
<br />flowerpot: Crack!
<br />&gt;look
<br />Herb Garden
<br />You can see two broken flowerpots and eight flowerpots here.
<br />&gt;get an unbroken flowerpot
<br />Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>There are in fact two slightly different forms of this kind of sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1389" -->
<a id="c1389"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
<br />Understand the broken property as referring to a flowerpot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The only difference is that in the &quot;describing&quot; case, the property's name alone can mean the thing in question - so &quot;take unbroken&quot; will work; whereas, in the &quot;referring to&quot;, the property's name can only be used as an adjective preceding the name of thing itself - so &quot;take unbroken flowerpot&quot; will work but &quot;take unbroken&quot; will not.</p>

<p>We've simulated a deck of cards before, but only as entries in a table. This time we're going to do it more completely, with card objects that can be drawn and discarded, and referred to by name. The tedious way to do this would be to make 52 objects by hand and laboriously write out their names and understand rules.</p>
<p>A more sensible way is to make 52 identical card objects, assign them ranks and suits, and allow Inform to generate and parse their names automatically.</p>

<p>This is enough already to let inform understand things like &quot;ten clubs&quot;, but we want to add a couple of refinements. For one thing, we'd like to accept &quot;of&quot; when it appears in phrases such as &quot;ten of clubs&quot; (but not generically otherwise); for another, we'd like the player to be able to use various names for ranks. To this end, we need to borrow from the Activities chapter and modify the player's command before attempting to understand it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11073" -->
<a id="c11073"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;of [suit]&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while the player's command includes &quot;of&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text;

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while the player's command includes topic entry:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the matched text with value entry.
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[This allows Inform to understand &quot;ace&quot;, &quot;deuce&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, etc., as numerical ranks.]
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It may be a bit confusing that the Table of Value Names has both a topic column and a term column, to all appearances essentially identical. But items in the topic column can be matched against the player's input, whereas items in other kinds of text column can be printed out; the two kinds of text are not treated identically by Inform, so we need to have both. Notice that the topic column contains entries like &quot;jack/knave,&quot; which will match either &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;knave&quot; in the player's input.</p>
<p>Now to set up the deck at the outset. With some intelligent looping, we avoid having to declare every combination of suit and number individually:</p>

<p>So:</p>

<p>This is enough already to let inform understand things like &quot;ten clubs&quot;, but we want to add a couple of refinements. For one thing, we'd like to accept &quot;of&quot; when it appears in phrases such as &quot;ten of clubs&quot; (but not generically otherwise); for another, we'd like the player to be able to use various names for ranks. To this end, we need to borrow from the Activities chapter and modify the player's command before attempting to understand it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c11137" -->
<a id="c11137"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;of [suit]&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while the player's command includes &quot;of&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;repeat through the Table of Value Names:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while the player's command includes topic entry:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the matched text with value entry.
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[This allows Inform to understand &quot;ace&quot;, &quot;deuce&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, etc., as numerical ranks.]
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It may be a bit confusing that the Table of Value Names has both a topic column and a term column, to all appearances essentially identical. But items in the topic column can be matched against the player's input, whereas items in other kinds of text column can be printed out; the two kinds of text are not treated identically by Inform, so we need to have both. Notice that the topic column contains entries like &quot;jack/knave,&quot; which will match either &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;knave&quot; in the player's input.</p>
<p>Now to set up the deck at the outset. With some intelligent looping, we avoid having to declare every combination of suit and number individually:</p>

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while a card is in the card repository:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;repeat with current rank running from 1 to 13:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let item be a random card in card repository;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now rank of item is current rank;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now suit of item is current suit;

<p>The above phrase rounds a number to the nearest five, so that the player is not autistically able to count a large number of cards in the discard pile at a single glance.</p>
<p>This next bit is an optional borrowing from the Activities chapter: we want to prevent Inform printing things like &quot;You can see a discard pile (closed) here.&quot;, since we don't want the player to think of the piles as containers, even though Inform thinks of them in those terms.</p>
