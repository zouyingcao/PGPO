<p>By default, Inform characters are a bit grudging about giving and sharing objects: they react with disinterest when they're shown things and refuse everything they're offered.</p>

<p>If we do this, giving items to characters will have the result of moving our possessions to the other person's inventory. Of course, without more customization, the player may not ever be able to persuade the other character to return his possessions. <span class="boldface">Bribery</span> demonstrates a scenario in which a character will accept gifts if they are interesting to him, and respond with a changed attitude to the player.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Barter Barter</span> expands further on this by allowing other characters to trade things with one another.</p>

<p>As it happens, correct behavior is built into the GIVE command once &quot;block giving&quot; is turned off, so we do not have to write a replacement report or carry-out rule; the object will be transferred to the possession of the caterpillar. But we do want to adjust the action just a little so that our gift cheers up the recipient:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c27554" -->
<a id="c27554"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out giving (this is the gratitude for gifts rule): improve the mood of the second noun.

<a id="c27555"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Mood is a kind of value. The moods are hostile, suspicious, indifferent, friendly, and adoring. An animal has a mood. An animal is usually indifferent.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now whenever we give something to an animal, the animal will be pleased about the present. Of course, we might also want to add a check rule to giving, to see whether the offering is something the recipient really wants:</p>

Check giving (this is the polite refusal of unwanted objects rule):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;unless the noun interests the second noun:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The second noun] disdainfully refuses [the noun].&quot; instead.

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;no.

<p>There is already a perfectly workable report rule that will describe what happens when we give something to someone, but let's say we want to report on the recipient's changed mood, too:</p>
