<p class="sectionheading">ยง13.12. Relations which express conditions</p>
<p>One last way to create a new relation and, in many ways, the easiest of all. If we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c985" -->
<a id="c985"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Contact relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or Y is part of X. The verb to be joined to means the contact relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then we would be able to talk about a handle being joined to a door, and a door being joined to a handle, and so on. We are not allowed to declare:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c986" -->
<a id="c986"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The hook is joined to the line.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because the question of whether they are joined is not for us to decide: that will be for the condition to determine, whenever we test it. Similarly, we cannot meaningfully write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c987" -->
<a id="c987"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the hook is joined to the line;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(and Inform will not let us) because this relation is not something we can force either way: we can make it come true by other means, maybe, but we cannot simply make it true by saying so. Lastly, this kind of relation is restricted in that we are not allowed to find paths or calculate numbers of steps through it.</p>
<p>So this way to define relations is, on the face of it, just a sort of verbal trick to write conditions in a more attractive way. The more flexible, changeable relations in previous sections have much greater expressive power. All the same, it is nice to be able to write -</p>
<!-- START CODE "c988" -->
<a id="c988"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Nearness relates a room (called A) to a room (called B) when the number of moves from B to A is less than 3. The verb to be near means the nearness relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and then to be able to write rules like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c989" -->
<a id="c989"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of listening when the location is near the Sundial: say &quot;You hear a splashing of water.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As with other relations, there's no reason why we have to use objects. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c990" -->
<a id="c990"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Material is a kind of value. The materials are wood and metal. A thing has a material.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c991" -->
<a id="c991"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Materiality relates a thing (called X) to a material (called Y) when Y is the material of X. The verb to be made of means the materiality relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which enables us to write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c992" -->
<a id="c992"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the cube is made of wood, ...
<br />say &quot;The carpenter looks at [the list of things which are made of wood].&quot;;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And here is a mathematical one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c993" -->
<a id="c993"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Divisibility relates a number (called N) to a number (called M) when the remainder after dividing M by N is 0. The verb to divide means the divisibility relation. The verb to be a factor of means the divisibility relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We now find that &quot;2 divides 12&quot;, &quot;5 is not a factor of 12&quot; and &quot;12 is divisible by 3&quot; are all true. Again, we are only really gaining a nice form of words, but improving the clarity of the source text is never a bad thing.</p>

<div class="egpanel" id="example54">
<p>Suppose we wanted to write rules for a character who will interact with doors in other locations even when the player is not present. This poses a little challenge: doors are actually single objects, and -- with the same shuffling of stage properties that applies to backdrops -- they are moved as needed to represent the door object in whatever room contains the player.</p>
<p>That means that it isn't safe to rely on a phrase like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c4960" -->
<a id="c4960"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if an open door is in the location of Bernard
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because, even if Bernard's location is connected by doors to other places, the actual representation of that door may not be &quot;in&quot; Bernard's location, from the model's point of view, at this exact moment.</p>
<p>This does not, of course, mean that we can't ask this question; just that we have to be a little cleverer about how we phrase it. Every door has properties that correspond to the two locations</p>
<p>linked:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c4961" -->
<a id="c4961"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the front side of the blue door (a room, which is arbitrarily one side of the door)
<br />the back side of the blue door (arbitrarily the other side)
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can make this information easier to check with a conditional relation, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c4962" -->
<a id="c4962"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Liminality relates a door (called X) to a room (called Y) when the front side of X is Y or the back side of X is Y. The verb to be a threshold of means the liminality relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And this allows us to write rules that have characters interacting with doors even in the player's absence:</p>
