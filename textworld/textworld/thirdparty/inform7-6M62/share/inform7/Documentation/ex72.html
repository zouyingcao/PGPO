<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.4. Try and try silently</p>
<p>Chapter 2 noted that surveys of Inform source text showed that the three most popular phrases used by authors are &quot;say&quot;, &quot;if&quot; and &quot;now&quot;. The fourth most popular is &quot;try&quot;, which allows us to trigger off actions ourselves, rather than waiting for the player to type something which generates them. Thus:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn69" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn69"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>try </b>(action)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_try -->

<p>This phrase makes the action, which has to be named literally, take effect now. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c472" -->
<a id="c472"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of entering the trapdoor, try going up.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It's as if the player had typed GO UP as a command. Note that the action has to be specific:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c473" -->
<a id="c473"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
try eating something;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is not allowed, since it doesn't say exactly what is to be eaten.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The word &quot;try&quot; is intended to make clear that there is no guarantee of success. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c474" -->
<a id="c474"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before locking the front door, try closing the front door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>could go wrong in any number of ways - perhaps the door is closed already, perhaps it is not openable, perhaps somebody has wedged it open. It would be safer to write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c475" -->
<a id="c475"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before locking the front door:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;try closing the front door;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the front door is open, stop the action.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There's no need to say anything if closing didn't work, because the closing action will have done that already. A neater approach still is to use:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn70" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn70"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>silently try </b>(action)<b></b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>try silently </b>(action)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_trysilently -->

<p>This phrase makes the action, which has to be named literally, take effect now, under the &quot;silent&quot; convention which means that routine messages aren't printed. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c476" -->
<a id="c476"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
try silently taking the napkin;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Silence is maintained only if this new action, the taking of the napkin, is successful (so if the napkin is successfully taken, the text &quot;Taken.&quot; will not appear): if the action should fail, a suitable objection will be voiced as usual.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>So now we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c477" -->
<a id="c477"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before locking the front door:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;try silently closing the front door;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the front door is open, stop the action.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And this is neater because it won't produce a pointless &quot;You close the front door.&quot; message.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to direct all -- or almost all -- actions from one object to another. For the sake of argument, say we have a sheet of paper with writing on it, and (because we're very meticulous) we want to let the player examine the writing and get a customized response, different from when he just examines the sheet of paper. But for all other purposes -- say, TAKE or TASTE -- we want the two objects to be treated as one.</p>
<p>Here, we approach the problem by changing the noun and/or the second noun of the current action, then issuing a new command to &quot;try the current action&quot;. Because we've changed the noun and second noun, the &quot;current action&quot; at this point is different from the one generated originally by the player's command.</p>
