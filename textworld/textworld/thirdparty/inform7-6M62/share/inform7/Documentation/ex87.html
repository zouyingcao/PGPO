<p class="sectionheading">ยง14.3. More on adapting verbs</p>
<p>If we need an adaptive message with a verb which doesn't belong to Inform's built-in set, all we need do is define it. In the previous chapter we defined verbs by giving them meanings, but in fact that's optional. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1038" -->
<a id="c1038"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To retrofit is a verb.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>defines a verb without telling Inform what it means. Inform will throw a Problem message if we try to write text like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1039" -->
<a id="c1039"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Flash retrofits the meteor beam.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because, after all, it doesn't know what &quot;retrofit&quot; means. But it does still know how to print it, so this works:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1040" -->
<a id="c1040"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[The actor] [retrofit] the Mecha-Mole.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which might come out as &quot;Dale retrofits the Mecha-Mole&quot;, or &quot;Barin's archers retrofitted the Mecha-Mole&quot;, and so on.</p>
<p>This is especially neat for writing a single response to an action which works regardless of who the actor was. For example, the Standard Rules include:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1041" -->
<a id="c1041"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;[The actor] [put] [the noun] on [the second noun].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And this can make either:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1042" -->
<a id="c1042"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You put the revolver on the table.
<br />General Lee puts the revolver on the table.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Mostly the Standard Rules use verbs adapted to finite forms (&quot;he jumped&quot;, &quot;we take the hammer&quot;, and so on). But Inform can also produce participles to describe actions that are ongoing: &quot;he is carrying the fedora&quot; or &quot;taking the hammer...&quot;</p>
