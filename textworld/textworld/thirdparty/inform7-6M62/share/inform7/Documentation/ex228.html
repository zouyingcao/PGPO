<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.10. Removing things from play</p>
<p>Some things will occasionally be in a limbo state called being &quot;off-stage&quot;: like actors or props not needed in Act II, but perhaps to be brought back on-stage later, they wait on the sidelines. Anything created with no apparent location will start the story off-stage, as in the case of the lamp here:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c585" -->
<a id="c585"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Aladdin's Cave is a room. The genie's lamp is a container.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Such things are easy to see in the World index because they are listed after all of the rooms and their contents, not belonging inside any room.) If we wanted to make this clearer to a human reader, we could add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c586" -->
<a id="c586"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The lamp is nowhere.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>to emphasise the point. In this context, &quot;nowhere&quot; means &quot;in no room&quot;. Moving the lamp onto the stage-set, so to speak, is easy:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c587" -->
<a id="c587"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the lamp is in the Cave;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or perhaps:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c588" -->
<a id="c588"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the player is carrying the lamp;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and we can whisk it away again like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c589" -->
<a id="c589"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the lamp is nowhere;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(We can't say &quot;now the lamp is somewhere&quot; because that's too vague about exactly where it is.) In older builds of Inform, the usual thing was to write &quot;remove the lamp from play&quot;, but that's now a deprecated phrase: better to use &quot;nowhere&quot; instead.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn77" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn77"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>remove </b>(object)<b> from play</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_remove -->

<p>Removes the given object from play, so that it is not present in any room. We are not permitted to remove rooms, or doors, or the player, from play; but we are permitted to remove backdrops, making them disappear from all rooms in which they are present. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c590" -->
<a id="c590"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
remove the gold coin from play;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We can test whether something is on-stage or off-stage with:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c591" -->
<a id="c591"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the gold coin is somewhere, ...
<br />if the gold coin is nowhere, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform also understands two adjectives for this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c592" -->
<a id="c592"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the gold coin is on-stage, ...
<br />if the gold coin is off-stage, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Because these are adjectives, they can be used in a few ways which &quot;nowhere&quot; and &quot;somewhere&quot; can't, such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c593" -->
<a id="c593"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;Ah, so many absent friends. Who now remembers [list of off-stage people]?&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that &quot;on-stage&quot; and &quot;off-stage&quot; apply only to things. Rooms, directions and regions are the stage itself: so it makes no sense to ask the question of whether they are &quot;on-&quot; or &quot;off-&quot;. Doors are always on-stage; a backdrop, say &quot;the sky&quot;, is always on-stage unless it has been taken off by writing something like &quot;now the sky is nowhere&quot;.</p>

<p>Suppose we have a supply closet in our game from which the player is allowed to take red pens. To keep modeling simple, we only allow him to have one in play at a time, and we test this by seeing whether the red pen is &quot;off-stage&quot; before moving it to his possession.</p>
<p>This approach might seem no different from having a single red pen sitting in the closet, but it may be preferable, for two reasons. First, it's not very plausible for a supply closet to contain nothing but a single red pen (well, assuming a well-regulated supplier, anyway); and second, it gives the player a way to get a new red pen should the original be destroyed in a tragic handwriting accident.</p>
