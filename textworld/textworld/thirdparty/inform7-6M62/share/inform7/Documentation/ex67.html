<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.3. Using the Scene index</p>
<p>But when we test the previous section's example, we find that after a brief wait, the train pulls up: but it never goes away again. We have given instructions on how the scene ends, but not when it ends, and as a result the scene goes on forever once started.</p>
<p>Even with simple story-lines, and this one could hardly be simpler, it is surprisingly easy to overlook something so that the whole story-line is derailed.</p>
<p>The Scenes page of the index is intended to help with this. The Plot section shows all of the scenes and how they are to begin, along with a key to the symbols used on it. One scene always included is &quot;Entire Game&quot;, a special scene which, as its name implies, is always being played out. But if we look at the Scene index for the previous example, we will also see our Train Stop scene, and find that it is marked with the red warning symbol for &quot;never ends&quot;. Let us fix this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c705" -->
<a id="c705"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Train Stop ends when the time since Train Stop began is 3 minutes.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note the useful value &quot;time since Train Stop began&quot;:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn111" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn111"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time since </b>(scene)<b> began ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimesincebegan -->

<p>This phrase produces the time since the named scene began, which only makes sense, of course, if it has indeed begun. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c706" -->
<a id="c706"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
time since Entire Game began
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn112" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn112"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time since </b>(scene)<b> ended ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimesinceended -->

<p>This phrase produces the time since the named scene ended, which only makes sense, of course, if it has indeed ended. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c707" -->
<a id="c707"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
time since Formal Dinner ended
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The actual times, in case they are needed, can be obtained with:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn113" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn113"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time when </b>(scene)<b> began ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimewhenbegan -->

<p>This phrase produces the time (i.e., the value of the &quot;time of day&quot; variable) at the moment when the given scene began.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn114" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn114"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>time when </b>(scene)<b> ended ... time</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_scenetimewhenended -->

<p>This phrase produces the time (i.e., the value of the &quot;time of day&quot; variable) at the moment when the given scene ended.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The testing command SCENES causes Inform to monitor the beginning and ending of scenes, and report on them. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c708" -->
<a id="c708"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;ask monk about lodging
<br />&quot;Welcome a poor traveler for the night?&quot; you ask, rubbing your fingers together to restore a little feeling.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c709" -->
<a id="c709"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The monk looks you up and down for a moment and you sense his reaction hanging in the balance; then he slaps you on the back, hard enough to drive the air from your lungs. &quot;In.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c710" -->
<a id="c710"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
[Scene 'Greeting' ends]
<br />The monk takes your elbow and pushes you imperiously toward dinner.
<br />[Scene 'Banquet' begins]
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
