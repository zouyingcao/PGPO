<p>&quot;Now&quot; has already appeared several times in this chapter, being used like a Swiss army knife to change values of all kinds:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c594" -->
<a id="c594"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the score is 100;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In fact, &quot;now&quot; is by far the most flexible phrase known to Inform.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn78" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn78"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>now </b>(a condition)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_now -->

<p>This phrase makes the condition become true. Examples:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c595" -->
<a id="c595"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
now the score is 100;
<br />now the player is Kevin;
<br />now the front door is open;
<br />now Mr Darcy is wearing the top hat;
<br />now all the doors are open;
<br />now all of the things in the sack are in the box;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform issues a problem message if the condition asks to do the impossible (&quot;now 3 is an even number&quot;) or is vague (&quot;now the duck is not in the Lily Pond&quot;) or not in the present tense (&quot;now the front door had been open&quot;).</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We've now seen all three things which can be done with a condition S which describes the world:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c596" -->
<a id="c596"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
S. - The relation holds at the start of play.
<br />if S, ...; - Does the relation hold right now?
<br />now S; - Make the relation hold from now on.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c597" -->
<a id="c597"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The apple is in the basket.
<br />if the apple is in the basket, ...;
<br />now the apple is in the basket;
