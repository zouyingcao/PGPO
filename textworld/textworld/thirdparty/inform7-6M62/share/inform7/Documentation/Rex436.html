<p>Just as Inform normally assumes everything is solid, it also assumes that these solid objects will not buckle, crack, break or deform under pressure, and cannot be fragmented. But breakability adds realism, and breakage need not be negative: sometimes we want the player to break her way in to something.</p>
<p>In IF the word DROP is more often used to mean &quot;put down&quot; or &quot;leave behind&quot; than &quot;let go from a height&quot;: so it is perhaps unfair that in <span class="boldface">Ming Vase</span> something fragile, when dropped, shatters (into nothing). In <span class="boldface">Spring Cleaning</span>, fragile objects must be explicitly attacked by the player in order to break, and although they leave no tangible debris behind, their loss is at least remembered. <span class="boldface">Kyoto</span> provides a general-purpose model for things being thrown at other things, with consequences including things moving (even between rooms) as well as breaking each other.</p>
<p>Debris from breakages is to be avoided if possible because it means keeping track of increasing numbers of objects. But we can increase realism by allowing something to have a visibly &quot;broken&quot; state, which it changes to when it breaks, rather than simply vanishing. <span class="boldface">Terracottissima</span> provides for broken and unbroken flowerpots in this way.</p>
<p>Since &quot;part of&quot; allows us to have two objects joined together into what the player sees as one, it also gives us a natural seam which allows the whole to be broken back down into its component parts, and this is the neatest way of providing a breakage into pieces. <span class="boldface">Paddington</span> demonstrates a cutting action which allows component parts to be cut away from their holders but will only make small surface gashes in any individual thing: so the player can cut something up, but only into the pieces we specifically choose to allow. Cutting also forces an opening into containers.</p>

<p>Some of those still look useful. We want to leave the &quot;implicitly remove thrown clothing&quot; rule, for instance -- no fair having the player throw a hat that's on his head. On the other hand, the &quot;futile to throw things at inanimate objects rule&quot; is going to have to go, because that would prevent us from ever being able to complete the throwing command. So let's get rid of that:</p>

<p>If the original rulebook is one we wrote ourselves, we could just add that rule in the proper spot in order. If we got it from an extension, though, we might need to put it in the right place explicitly:</p>

<p>The magic of rulebooks is that they allow authors to amend each other's work (or the Standard Rules) with a fair amount of freedom. A well-written extension will give individual names to its rules, to allow subsequent authors to modify the function of the extension without too much trouble.</p>

<p>Some of those still look useful. We want to leave the &quot;implicitly remove thrown clothing&quot; rule, for instance -- no fair having the player throw a hat that's on his head.

Part 1 - Throwing Rules
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37660" -->
<a id="c37660"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The futile to throw things at inanimate objects rule is not listed in the check throwing it at rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That &quot;block throwing at&quot; rule also looks sinister: any &quot;block...&quot; rule in the standard actions library is there to print a message telling the player he can't do what he's asked to do.</p>
<p>But it's not enough to ignore it, the way we did the &quot;futile&quot; rule. Since we are only expanding the command to affect inanimate objects, let's replace the &quot;block throwing at&quot; rule with a different one which will only prevent the player throwing things at people:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37661" -->
<a id="c37661"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The block throwing at people rule is listed instead of the block throwing at rule in the check throwing it at rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37662" -->
<a id="c37662"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
This is the block throwing at people rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the second noun is a person, say &quot;That might be construed as an attack.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we've changed the command so that some action can sometimes be carried out here -- but we don't have any rules for what happens. It's time to create some rules for our model world.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37663" -->
<a id="c37663"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing can be hard or soft. A thing can be fragile or strong. Shape is a kind of value. The shapes are round, flat, and linear. A thing has shape.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If we're actually going to allow throwing, we might want to add a couple of extra checks to the rulebook to make sure that this happens when it ought:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37664" -->
<a id="c37664"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Check throwing it at (this is the block juggling rule):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is carrying the second noun, say &quot;It would be difficult to throw at something you are yourself holding.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37665" -->
<a id="c37665"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Check throwing it at (this is the avoid throwing things into themselves rule):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the second noun is within the noun, say &quot;That would be a nice magic trick.&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And then the rules for the action itself:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37666" -->
<a id="c37666"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out throwing it at (this is the check aerodynamics rule):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is flat:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;move noun to location;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The noun], unwieldy, flutters to the ground.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;rule succeeds.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That &quot;rule succeeds&quot; ends the action here, if the noun is flat. If not, Inform goes on to the next rule in the carry out throwing it at rulebook:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37667" -->
<a id="c37667"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out throwing it at (this is the contact rule):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The noun] hits [the second noun].[paragraph break]&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the second noun is fragile and the noun is hard:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;destroy the second noun.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37668" -->
<a id="c37668"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out throwing it at (this is the landing rule):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let destination be the location;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the second noun is on a supporter (called endtable), let destination be the endtable;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the second noun is a supporter, let destination be the second noun;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;move the noun to the destination;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the noun is fragile and the second noun is hard:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;destroy the noun;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;rule succeeds;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The noun] lands [if the destination is the location]nearby[otherwise]on [the destination][end if].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These rules are assuming some backup information, so let's provide that as well:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37669" -->
<a id="c37669"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Reliance relates a thing (called X) to a thing (called Y) when X is part of Y or X is in Y or X is on Y. The verb to be relying on means the reliance relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37670" -->
<a id="c37670"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To destroy (item - a thing):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let home be the holder of the item;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the item is part of something (called the superstructure), let home be the holder of the superstructure;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the item is visible:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The item] breaks[if something is relying on the item], leaving [a list of things which are relying on the item] behind[end if].&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if something is relying on the item,
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now all the things which are relying on the item are in the home;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the item is nowhere.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now suppose we'd like to add some further cases for what happens if the player breaks a fragile door this way:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37671" -->
<a id="c37671"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To destroy (item - a door):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the item is open;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the item is unopenable;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The item] smashes.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37672" -->
<a id="c37672"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of an unopenable open door while not throwing something at something:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;open doorway&quot;.

<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c37673" -->
<a id="c37673"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;door&quot; or &quot;doorway&quot; as a door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This works, except that objects will continue to &quot;strike&quot; open, unopenable doors, with the result that the player can smash the same door over and over. What we need is another rule, after the aerodynamics rule and before the contact rule, that tells Inform how to handle throwing things at open doors.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37674" -->
<a id="c37674"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
This is the flying through doorways rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the second noun is an open door:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the distant room be the other side of the second noun;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;move the noun to the distant room;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;[The noun] flies out of sight into [the distant room].&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;rule succeeds.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If the original rulebook is one we wrote ourselves, we could just add that rule in the proper spot in order. If we got it from an extension, though, we might need to put it in the right place explicitly:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c37675" -->
<a id="c37675"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The flying through doorways rule is listed before the contact rule in the carry out throwing it at rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The magic of rulebooks is that they allow authors to amend each other's work (or the Standard Rules) with a fair amount of freedom. A well-written extension will give individual names to its rules, to allow subsequent authors to modify the function of the extension without too much trouble.</p>
<p>Now for an actual scenario with which to test this:</p>
