<p class="sectionheading">ยง13.13. Relations involving values</p>
<p>Although most of the examples in this chapter have involved objects, relations can connect almost any values together. We can create relations in groups, one to various relations, various to one relations, one to one relations, and various to various relations for any combination of kinds. For example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c994" -->
<a id="c994"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Partnership relates various texts to various texts.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c995" -->
<a id="c995"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to belong with means the
<br />partnership relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c996" -->
<a id="c996"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;cheese&quot; belongs with &quot;crackers&quot;.
<br />&quot;clam&quot; belongs with &quot;chowder&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>How might we make use of this? Clearly it would be impractical to keep trying:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c997" -->
<a id="c997"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if &quot;caviar&quot; belongs with &quot;aardvarks&quot;, ...
<br />if &quot;caviar&quot; belongs with &quot;abacuses&quot;, ...
<br />...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>to find out what &quot;caviar&quot; belongs with. It's still harder to find out if it belongs with anything at all -- in theory we would have to try every possibility, which of course is impossible. Instead we have these phrases:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn159" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn159"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(value)<b> relates to </b>(name of kind)<b> by </b>(relation of values to values)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_ifleft -->

<p>This condition is true if the value V is such that V relates to something by the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can test</p>
<!-- START CODE "c998" -->
<a id="c998"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if &quot;chalk&quot; relates to a text by the partnership relation, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn160" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn160"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(name of kind)<b> relates to </b>(value)<b> by </b>(relation of values to values)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_ifright -->

<p>This condition is true if the value V is such that something relates to V by the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can test</p>
<!-- START CODE "c999" -->
<a id="c999"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if a text relates to &quot;cheese&quot; by the partnership relation, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>If a partner does exist, then we can find it with:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn161" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn161"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> to which</b>/whom<b> </b>(value)<b> relates by </b>(relation of values to values)<b> ... value</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> that</b>/which/whom<b> </b>(value)<b> relates to by </b>(relation of values to values)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_rightlookup -->

<p>This phrase produces an Y such that the given value V relates to Y by the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1000" -->
<a id="c1000"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the text to which &quot;chalk&quot; relates by the partnership relation
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which might be, say, &quot;cheese&quot;. It's a run-time problem to use this if no such Y exists.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn162" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn162"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(name of kind)<b> that</b>/which/who<b> relates to </b>(value)<b> by </b>(relation of values to values)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_leftlookup -->

<p>This phrase produces an X such that X relates to the given value V by the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1001" -->
<a id="c1001"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the text which relates to &quot;cheese&quot; by the partnership relation
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which might be, say, &quot;chalk&quot;. It's a run-time problem to use this if no such X exists.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Of course, there might be many answers to this question, so perhaps these are neater:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn163" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn163"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>list of </b>(name of kind)<b> that</b>/which/who<b> relate to </b>(value)<b> by </b>(relation of values to values)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_leftlookuplist -->

<p>This phrase produces a list of all the X such that X relates to the given value V by the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1002" -->
<a id="c1002"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
list of texts which relate to &quot;cheese&quot; by the partnership relation
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which might be, say, { &quot;chalk&quot;, &quot;grapes&quot;, &quot;macaroni&quot; }. The answer might be the empty set, but that's not a problem.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn164" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn164"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>list of </b>(name of kind)<b> to which</b>/whom<b> </b>(value)<b> relates by </b>(relation of values to values)<b> ... value</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>list of </b>(name of kind)<b> that</b>/which/whom<b> </b>(value)<b> relates to by </b>(relation of values to values)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_rightlookuplist -->

<p>This phrase produces a list of all Y such that the given value V relates to Y by the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1003" -->
<a id="c1003"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
list of texts to which &quot;chalk&quot; relates by the partnership relation
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which might be, say, { &quot;cheese&quot;, &quot;blackboard&quot;, &quot;cliffs&quot; }. The answer might be the empty set, but that's not a problem.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Finally, it's sometimes useful to get at the list of all values which can appear on the left or right hand side of a relation. We need tongue-twister like wording to do it, but:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn165" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn165"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>list of </b>(name of kind)<b> that</b>/which/whom<b> </b>(relation of values to values)<b> relates ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_leftdomain -->

<p>This phrase produces a list of all X which relate to anything under the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1004" -->
<a id="c1004"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
list of texts which the partnership relation relates
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn166" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn166"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>list of </b>(name of kind)<b> to which</b>/whom<b> </b>(relation of values to values)<b> relates ... value</b></p><br /><i>or:</i>&#160;&#160;&#160;<p class="defnprototype"><b>list of </b>(name of kind)<b> that</b>/which/whom<b> </b>(relation of values to values)<b> relates to ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_rightdomain -->

<p>This phrase produces a list of all Y which anything relates to under the given relation. Example: suppose partnership relates various texts to various texts. Then we can obtain</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1005" -->
<a id="c1005"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
list of texts which the partnership relation relates to
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>For efficiency reasons, there are no guarantees about what order these lists have - but they can of course always be sorted when found.</p>
