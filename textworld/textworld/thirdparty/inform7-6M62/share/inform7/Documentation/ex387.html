<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.13. Locks and keys</p>
<p>It seems unwise for a door in Notting Hill to be unlocked, so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c134" -->
<a id="c134"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The blue door is lockable and locked. The matching key of the blue door is the brass Yale key.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Since the second sentence here is a little clumsy, we can equivalently say</p>
<!-- START CODE "c135" -->
<a id="c135"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The brass Yale key unlocks the blue door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Yet a third way to say this is:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c136" -->
<a id="c136"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The blue door has matching key the brass Yale key.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This introduces three new properties: a door can be locked or unlocked; lockable or not lockable; and it can have a matching key, which must be another thing. The same thing can be the matching key of many different locks: and note that a door can be locked and even lockable without having a matching key at all, in which case the player trying to open it will be permanently out of luck. Doors are ordinarily unlocked, not lockable, and without a matching key.</p>
<p>Containers can also have locks, in exactly the same way, and are allowed to have the same properties. On the other hand supporters never have locks: it makes no sense to be able to lock a tabletop, for instance, and Inform will not allow any discussion of the matching key of a supporter, or of a supporter being locked or unlocked.</p>

<p>Now there's a silver key that will unlock it -- though since we haven't said where the key is, the player will never be able to find it in the game. (If we look at the World index, we find &quot;small silver key&quot; right at the bottom, not inside any of the rooms. That is as good as not existing at all -- though we usually use the term &quot;out of play&quot; -- but as we will later see, it is possible to have things initially out of play but brought into existence later on.)</p>
