<p>A few actions apply not to items alone, but also involve what might be called conversation. The first is the one used for looking things up in books (which is conversation of a kind, even if the author is not present): &quot;consulting ... about ...&quot;. For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c480" -->

<!-- START CODE "c481" -->
<a id="c481"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After consulting the book about &quot;grove&quot;, say &quot;The Grove is a sacred yadda, yadda. There's a tree, that sort of thing. Wisdom.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c482" -->
<a id="c482"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that what follows &quot;about&quot; here is a piece of text in double-quotes, and not the name of something. It can be almost any text at all, and in fact we shall later see (in the chapter on &quot;Understanding&quot;) that we can match complicated patterns of words, too.</p>
<p>Similar actions are used for conversing with people:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c483" -->
<a id="c483"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After asking the Sybil about &quot;verses&quot;, say &quot;She blushes.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c484" -->
<a id="c484"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After telling the Sybil about &quot;persians&quot;, say &quot;She nods gravely.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c485" -->
<a id="c485"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After answering the Sybil that &quot;I am mad&quot;, say &quot;She sighs.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These would be produced by commands like &quot;ask sybil about verses&quot;, &quot;tell sybil about persians&quot; and &quot;answer i am mad&quot;. Answering is little-used except that it also catches commands like &quot;sybil, something unrecognized&quot;, which inexperienced players sometimes type. Asking and telling, however, are important actions and the difference between them is often worth preserving. If you would prefer to make &quot;tell sybil about X&quot; do the same as &quot;ask sybil about X&quot;, the following rule would serve:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c486" -->
<a id="c486"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of telling the Sybil about something, try asking the Sybil about it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Games with a lot of conversation often involve great heaps of rules like the ones above, which can be repetitious to type out. We shall also later see (in the chapter on &quot;Tables&quot;) that we can tabulate questions and answers in a much more concise way, if we prefer.</p>

<p>The complexity arises from the fact that we want to handle both YES and SYBIL, YES. If we only had the latter, 'yes' would be treated as a text given to the Sybil, just as in the commands SAY YES TO SYBIL or ANSWER YES. But because we have defined it as a command (so that the player can use it independently), SYBIL, YES is understood as an order to the Sybil to do the YES action.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we can redirect everything, as here, so that the results wind up the same.</p>
<p>And if we want yet another variation not covered by the Inform standard:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c9788" -->
<a id="c9788"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;tell [someone] [text]&quot; as answering it that. Understand &quot;tell [someone] that [text]&quot; as answering it that.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But that is a matter for a later chapter.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c9789" -->
<a id="c9789"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test me with &quot;yes / sybil, yes / say yes to sybil / answer yes / tell sybil yes / no / sybil, no / say no to sybil / answer no / tell sybil no /  sorry / sybil, sorry / say sorry to sybil / answer sorry / tell sybil sorry&quot;.
