<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.8. Multiple endings</p>
<p>Interactive fictions vary considerably in the extent to which the player is allowed to influence the story-line. Sometimes the appearance of making choices is wholly bogus, as only one possible line is given more than lip service. But in other works, the player can radically change the outcome, and whole rafts of plot differ between one person's experience and another's. Inform allows multiple endings to its scenes to make this kind of branching story-line easy to achieve.</p>
<p>Any scene can have up to 31 alternate endings, differentiated by name (unless the Z-machine format has been selected on the Settings panel, in which case, 15). These alternates are created as and when conditions are set for them:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c723" -->
<a id="c723"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Brief Encounter ends happily when ...
<br />Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly when ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Ends happily&quot; and &quot;ends wisely but sadly&quot; behave just like &quot;ends&quot;. We can have rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends happily, ...&quot; and so forth, in addition to rules &quot;When Brief Encounter ends, ...&quot; - if a rule doesn't specify any particular ending, it applies to all of them.</p>
<p>We can also link rules together from these branches, so</p>
<!-- START CODE "c724" -->
<a id="c724"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Stranger's Acceptance begins when Brief Encounter ends happily.
<br />Stranger's Rejection begins when Brief Encounter ends wisely but sadly.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>With this set-up and that of the previous section, there are now two possible paths through the story:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c725" -->
<a id="c725"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
(i) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Acceptance - Bittersweet Ending
<br />(ii) Train Stop - Brief Encounter - Stranger's Rejection - Bittersweet Ending
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We might later need to know which of these paths has been taken, and to help with this Inform provides conditions like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c726" -->
<a id="c726"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Brief Encounter ended happily ...
<br />if Brief Encounter did not end happily ...
<br />if Brief Encounter ended wisely but sadly ...
<br />if Brief Encounter did not end wisely but sadly ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(For a scene which repeats, note that these conditions apply only to the most recent repetition: and that such conditions are always false if the scene is currently going on. &quot;Brief Encounter did not end happily&quot; will be true only when the scene has finished but in a different way.)</p>

[=0x0022=]Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren[=0x0027=]t very well-boarded, and don[=0x0027=]t keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there[=0x0027=]s the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Pigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is [=0x0022=]They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what[=0x0027=]s worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there[=0x0027=]s less and less for them to forage on.[=0x0022=] Instead of smelling the pigs: say [=0x0022=]They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.[=0x0022=]; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The brothers are a man in the shack. The brothers are scenery. The description of brothers is [=0x0022=]Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother[=0x0027=]s health does not improve.[=0x0022=] Understand [=0x0022=]brother[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]twin[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]twins[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]baby[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]franz[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]hans[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]lukas[=0x0022=] as the brothers.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is [=0x0022=]She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn[=0x0027=]t been the same since your father left.[=0x0022=] On the bed is a folded letter.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the letter is [=0x0022=]Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow. She looks up at you, her oldest -- yes, never mind that bit -- with a look of sincere trust and admiration.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=][=0x0027=]You[=0x0027=]ll find a way through this for us,[=0x0027=] she says, squeezing your fingers.

<p>Notice that we moved the re-activation rule down here so that the Compromise Proposal rule would fire first. There are other more complicated ways of handling order of every turn rules than by relying on text sequence alone; but we will save that for a later chapter.
