<p class="sectionheading">ยง15.12. Making the verb "to weigh"</p>
<p>So now we can invent notations for weight. We could, for instance, write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1178" -->
<a id="c1178"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Weight is a kind of value. 1kg specifies a weight. Every thing has a weight.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And that allows us to write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1179" -->
<a id="c1179"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The lead pig is in the Salt Mine. The weight of the lead pig is 45kg.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But nobody would say it that way: they'd say &quot;The lead pig weighs 45kg.&quot; So what we really need to complete our setup is a verb &quot;to weigh&quot;.</p>
<p>We have already created new verbs, but none of those methods are quite convenient for this. We want to relate something tangible (the lead pig) to something intangible (45kg), and there's no convenient relation to express this; if we set it up as a condition, we'd get something we couldn't assert, only test. Instead, we'll do something different this time:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1180" -->
<a id="c1180"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The verb to weigh means the weight property.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Previous definitions like this ended &quot;means the ... relation&quot;, rather than &quot;means the ... property&quot;, but the idea is the same. The meaning of &quot;X weighs Y&quot; is that the weight property of X is equal to Y. So we can now write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1181" -->
<a id="c1181"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A thing usually weighs 1kg. The lead pig weighs 45kg.
<br />something weighing 20kg
<br />if three things weigh 5kg, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And as we saw in the chapter on Descriptions, we can also set up adjectives, comparatives and superlatives:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1182" -->
<a id="c1182"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A thing is heavy if its weight is 20kg or more.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which creates &quot;heavy&quot;, &quot;heavier&quot; and &quot;heaviest&quot;.</p>
