<p>The viewpoint character may often need to remember events long past. The easiest way to do this is with a cut-scene, in which at some relevant point we pause the story and print a long passage of text describing the memory. Because large amounts of text can be hard for the player to take in, we may want to include some pauses in the presentation of this material; this facility is provided by the Basic Screen Effects extension by Emily Short, and might work something like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23613" -->
<a id="c23613"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Include Basic Screen Effects by Emily Short.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23614" -->
<a id="c23614"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of examining the photograph for the first time:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;This reminds you of the summer of '69...&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;wait for any key;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;... flashback content...&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;wait for any key.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;pause the game&quot; phrase in the same extension offers a more dramatic pause that also clears the screen before printing new text.</p>
<p>Cut-scenes are easy to implement but should be used sparingly, since players often get impatient with long uninteractive passages. A slightly more deluxe implementation might insert an interactive scene that simply happens to be set in the past, before going on with another scene set &quot;now&quot;; and, indeed, some IF abandons the idea of &quot;now&quot; entirely, presenting pieces in a non-chronological order and letting the player work out how the sequence works together.</p>
<p>The most challenging case to implement (though still not very hard) is the one where we remove the player from one scenario, let him play through a flashback with past possessions and clothing, and then restore him to the same situation he left, with all of the same possessions and clothing. <span class="boldface">Pine 3</span> shows how to do this: the code to change the player's status is isolated at the end of the example, and might fruitfully be reused.  <span class="boldface">Pine 4</span> expands on the same idea by adding another flashback scene, demonstrating one that can be visited repeatedly and one that can be seen only once.</p>

[=0x0022=]Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren[=0x0027=]t very well-boarded, and don[=0x0027=]t keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated.

The pigs are scenery. The description is [=0x0022=]They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what[=0x0027=]s worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there[=0x0027=]s less and less for them to forage on.[=0x0022=] Instead of smelling the pigs: say [=0x0022=]They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.[=0x0022=]; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The brothers are a man.

Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is [=0x0022=]She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn[=0x0027=]t been the same since your father left.[=0x0022=] On the bed is a folded letter.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the letter is [=0x0022=]Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return.

[=0x0022=]Your family lives in a shack in the forest. There are holes in the roof, and in the winter the snow comes in -- rain, too, for that matter. The walls aren[=0x0027=]t very well-boarded, and don[=0x0027=]t keep out the wind, and even though you live in the middle of dense woods, you can never gather enough fuel to keep this place fully heated. And then there[=0x0027=]s the stench. Pigs wander freely in and out, and your three youngest brothers play on the floor.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Pigs are an animal in the shack. The pigs are scenery. The description is [=0x0022=]They really are very grubby, dirty animals, but what[=0x0027=]s worse than that, the value of pigs has declined a lot over the last few decades. This is hard to explain to someone who has been out of touch with the world for a while, but keeping pigs for meat is a dubious prospect when there[=0x0027=]s less and less for them to forage on.[=0x0022=] Instead of smelling the pigs: say [=0x0022=]They smell the way animals do, when they live among their own refuse.[=0x0022=]; increase the pity of Beauty by 2.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The brothers are a man. The description of brothers is [=0x0022=]Hans, Franz, and Lukas. Twins and then the baby. So young, and growing up fatherless; and soon to be orphaned entirely, if your mother[=0x0027=]s health does not improve.[=0x0022=] Understand [=0x0022=]brother[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]twin[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]twins[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]baby[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]franz[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]hans[=0x0022=] or [=0x0022=]lukas[=0x0022=] as the brothers.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The untidy bed is scenery in the Shack. Mother is a woman on the untidy bed. The description of mother is [=0x0022=]She is wasting away of a slow disease, her skin stretched tautly over bone. She hasn[=0x0027=]t been the same since your father left.[=0x0022=] On the bed is a folded letter.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The description of the letter is [=0x0022=]Many times read over and creased, the letter explains how your father has gone away with a wealthy countess and will not return. Your mother was not able to read it herself, of course, and had to have it explained to her by the parish priest. Now she keeps it by the bed and crumples it in her fits of delirium.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of kissing or touching Mother for the first time:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]You place a gentle kiss on her feverish brow.

[=0x0027=]I know you will.[=0x0027=][=0x0022=]; increase the pity of Beauty by 3.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of kissing Mother: say [=0x0022=]You have no more heart-rending memories of affection to recount; that one incident will have to serve, for rhetorical purposes.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of waiting in the Shack: say [=0x0022=]The wind blows sharply through the walls.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Instead of attacking someone in the Shack:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Though sometimes the conditions of your life make you grouchy and impatient, you would never dream of striking a member of your own family. But from time to time you do feel the temptation.[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Beauty has a number called pity. After examining something in the Woodcutter[=0x0027=]s Shack, increment the pity of Beauty. After examining mother, increase the pity of Beauty by 2. After examining the letter, increase the pity of Beauty by 3.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]Poverty flashback ends when waiting or the time since poverty flashback began is five minutes.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]When Poverty flashback ends:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]now family circumstances is past;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]...you finish describing the miserable circumstances of your home life, and allow your attention to return to the present.[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]restore the player;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]now Beauty is passive;[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if Beauty is sympathetic, say [=0x0022=][=0x0027=]Oh dear![=0x0027=] she says.
