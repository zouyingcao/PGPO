<p>What should fit into what? Inform has basically three sizes: small, person-sized, and room-sized. The difference between &quot;small&quot; and &quot;person-sized&quot; doesn't appear much, but it's the difference between an ordinary container and an enterable container; the fact that a person cannot get inside an ordinary container is one of the few size-related rules built into Inform. It will not object to, say, a fishing rod being put inside a matchbox.</p>
<p>Inform does have one built-in measure of the size of a container: its &quot;carrying capacity&quot;. This is a maximum number of contents:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23735" -->
<a id="c23735"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The carrying capacity of the rucksack is 3.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This of course allows three anvils, while forbidding four postage stamps. To do better, we need units of measurement, and <span class="boldface">Dimensions</span> demonstrates setting these up. <span class="boldface">The Speed of Thought</span>, meanwhile, ventures into the area of unit conversion: having multiple types of unit and being able to express them to the player, or parse these in the player's input.</p>
<p>To be fully realistic in what will fit into what, we need sophisticated three-dimensional models of shapes, both of the items being carried and of the free space remaining inside containers. <span class="boldface">Depth</span> elegantly simplifies this by approximating items as cuboids, with a given width, length and height: these multiply to give a volume. To fit in a container, a new item's volume must not exceed the volume remaining inside the container, and in addition its three dimensions must also fit in one of the possible arrangements at right angles to the sides. (So this system would indeed prevent a 1x1x100 fishing rod from being put inside a 5x2x1 matchbox, but would also prevent a 12x1x1 pencil from being put into a 10x10x1 box, because it would need to be turned diagonally to fit.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Lead Cuts Paper</span> provides a different constraint: here we do not let light-weight containers hold heavy objects.</p>
<p>Weight comes in a different way into <span class="boldface">Swerve left? Swerve right? Or think about it and die?</span>, which exploits up/down map connections to work out which way gravity would take a rolling marble.</p>

Understand &quot;stand&quot; or &quot;stand up&quot; as standing up. Standing up is an action applying to nothing. Check standing up: if the player is lumpy, say &quot;You are already standing.&quot; Carry out standing up: now the player is lumpy. Report standing up: say &quot;You get to your feet.&quot;

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now a rule to control what happens to all our sliding and rolling objects:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c25291" -->
<a id="c25291"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every turn:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;repeat with item running through spherical things which are in sloping rooms:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the current space be the holder of the item;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let the final space be a random room which is overlooked by the current space;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player can see the item and the item is a marble, say &quot;[The item] rolls out of the room toward [the final space].[line break]&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player is the item, say &quot;You keep sliding...&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;move the item to the final space;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player can see the item and the item is a marble, say &quot;[The item] rolls into the room from [the current space].[line break]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Since the Ski-jump overlooks the Landing Bowl, the marble will be able to fly through the air to its destination, even though there is no map connection to allow the player to cross. We might want to let the player make it across this barrier also, so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c25292" -->
<a id="c25292"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of jumping in a sloping room:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You leap...&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;move the player to a random room overlooked by the location.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Because overlooking is various-to-various, we could include that element popular in marble chute toys, the splitter:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c25293" -->
<a id="c25293"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Downhill Splitter is north of the Long Yellow Slide. &quot;The green plastic chute runs downhill towards a Y-junction, forcing incoming marbles right or left.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c25294" -->
<a id="c25294"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Downhill Splitter overlooks the Long Yellow Slide and the Purple Snaking Passage. The Purple Snaking Passage is southeast of the Downhill Splitter. The Purple Snaking Passage overlooks the Landing Bowl. The Purple Snaking Passage is above the Landing Bowl.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c25295" -->
<a id="c25295"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is in the Downhill Splitter.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c25296" -->
<a id="c25296"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Test me with &quot;drop red / drop blue / sit / z / stand up / drop agate / sit / z / z / z / z / z&quot;.
