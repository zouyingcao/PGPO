<p>For eating something not immediately to hand, see <span class="boldface">Lollipop Guild</span>. <span class="boldface">Delicious, Delicious Rocks</span>, conversely, adds a sanity check which prevents the player from automatically taking inedible things only to be told they can't be eaten.</p>
<p>Inform does not normally simulate taste or digestion, but to provide foods with a range of flavours, see <span class="boldface">Would you...?</span>; to make eating different foods affect the player differently, see <span class="boldface">Stone</span>, or for the extreme case of poisoning foods, <span class="boldface">Candy</span>. In <span class="boldface">MRE</span>, hunger causes the player problems unless he regularly finds and eats food.</p>

<p>A thing can have a rule as a property, if we like. Here we are going to allow the player to make a soup whose effects will depend on its ingredients. Each ingredient will have its own &quot;food effect&quot; rule, to be followed when the food is eaten.</p>
<p>Note that there are other, slightly less cumbersome ways to do the same thing -- we will see in the chapter on Rulebooks that we could make a &quot;food effects rulebook&quot; and then write a number of rules such as &quot;food effects rule for carrots&quot; or &quot;food effects rule for the stone&quot;. Nonetheless, we demonstrate rules-as-properties here for the sake of thoroughness.</p>

<p>A thing can have a rule as a property, if we like. Here we are going to allow the player to make a soup whose effects will depend on its ingredients. Each ingredient will have its own &quot;food effect&quot; rule, to be followed when the food is eaten.</p>
<p>Note that there are other, slightly less cumbersome ways to do the same thing -- we will see in the chapter on Rulebooks that we could make a &quot;food effects rulebook&quot; and then write a number of rules such as &quot;food effects rule for carrots&quot; or &quot;food effects rule for the stone&quot;. Nonetheless, we demonstrate rules-as-properties here for the sake of thoroughness.</p>
