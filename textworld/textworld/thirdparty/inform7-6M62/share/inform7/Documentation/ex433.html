<p>In this scenario, the player starts with a bag full of unsorted letters. These can be polite or rude, but he won't know which until he has examined them.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The rules about taking are more subtle: the player is more likely to want to take an ungrouped letter than a grouped one; he is more likely to want one from the satchel than not; and he is most unlikely to want to take a letter (grouped or ungrouped) that he is already holding.</p>

<p>Now, there's a good bit of interaction to streamline. We intend that the player will be taking letters from the satchel, reading them, and putting them (perhaps grouped) into boxes.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The rules about taking are more subtle: the player is more likely to want to take an ungrouped letter than a grouped one; he is more likely to want one from the satchel than not; and he is most unlikely to want to take a letter (grouped or ungrouped) that he is already holding.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c22815" -->
<a id="c22815"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;it is possible.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And finally, we will assume by default that anything other than examining or taking is most likely to apply to a letter he's already identified:</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And we would also like to understand properties under the same circumstances as printing -- a letter will be identifiable as &quot;polite&quot; if it's already been read and it is either by itself or in a sorted stack of polite letters, but otherwise not.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That last &quot;repeat&quot; is merely a device to shuffle the order of items in the satchel so that the player will not always encounter the letters in a neatly presorted order, despite our defining them that way.

<p>In this scenario, the player starts with a bag full of unsorted letters. These can be polite or rude, but he won't know which until he has examined them. What's more, he is allowed to sort the letters, in which case a group of letters will be shown as (for instance) &quot;two polite letters&quot;; but a group of mixed letters, even if they have all been read, will be called &quot;unsorted letters&quot;.</p>
<p>Further, the player should be allowed to refer to sorted letters by tone, but not unsorted letters.</p>
<p>To do this, we'll need printing the name... and printing the plural name..., as well as some special understanding rules.</p>

<p>Now, there's a good bit of interaction to streamline. We intend that the player will be taking letters from the satchel, reading them, and putting them (perhaps grouped) into boxes. Our interaction rules should assist in this process as much as possible. To start with, the player will be most likely to examine letters he hasn't read yet:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c22836" -->
<a id="c22836"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Does the player mean examining a letter (called the subject):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if we have examined the subject, it is very unlikely;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;it is very likely.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The rules about taking are more subtle: the player is more likely to want to take an ungrouped letter than a grouped one; he is more likely to want one from the satchel than not; and he is most unlikely to want to take a letter (grouped or ungrouped) that he is already holding.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c22837" -->
<a id="c22837"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player carries the subject, it is very unlikely;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the subject is in the satchel, it is possible;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;it is unlikely.

<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c22838" -->
<a id="c22838"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;it is possible.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And finally, we will assume by default that anything other than examining or taking is most likely to apply to a letter he's already identified:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c22839" -->
<a id="c22839"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And we would also like to understand properties under the same circumstances as printing -- a letter will be identifiable as &quot;polite&quot; if it's already been read and it is either by itself or in a sorted stack of polite letters, but otherwise not. What's more, to make it possible to disambiguate commands in the other direction, we'll call any unsorted letter &quot;random&quot;, to represent that the player doesn't know what it is.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c22840" -->

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That last &quot;repeat&quot; is merely a device to shuffle the order of items in the satchel so that the player will not always encounter the letters in a neatly presorted order, despite our defining them that way.
