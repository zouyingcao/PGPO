<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.3. Animals</p>
<p>Animals exhibit a wide range of behaviour: much of the chapter on Other Characters applies just as well to animals as to human beings, with the exception of the material on conversation. But two examples here, both fairly simple, show how a fairly convincing domestic pet can be achieved simply by reacting to certain events going on nearby: <span class="boldface">Feline Behavior</span> (a cat) and <span class="boldface">Today Tomorrow</span> (a dog).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Fido</span> provides a dog which the player can re-name at will.</p>
<p>For animals that we can sit on and ride - a camel or a horse, say - we may want to use the Rideable Vehicles extension by Graham Nelson, which also provides a rideable animal kind.</p>

The player carries a double bacon cheeseburger and a chocolate shake. Understand &quot;milkshake&quot; or &quot;beverage&quot; as the shake. The description of the cheeseburger is &quot;A minor self-indulgence to make up for the fact that you have to work through lunch.&quot; The cheeseburger is edible. The shake is edible. The description of the shake is &quot;It has the consistency of spackle and is no longer cold, but there is some chocolatey goodness in it still.&quot; Understand &quot;burger&quot; or &quot;hamburger&quot; as the cheeseburger. Instead of drinking the chocolate shake: try eating the shake instead.

<p>Unless we somehow get the trenchcoat away from Maya, the chihuahua will not be in view, and will not intervene in our lunch. All very well for the player character, but not so interesting to the story... To this end, we might add an unfortunate event, courtesy of later chapters:</p>

At 11:47 AM: say &quot;Your boss pokes his head in, temporarily free of the round of conference calls that occupy all his days. 'Maya,' he says. 'Your coat?' He shakes his head, clucking sadly. 'It doesn't say professional!' But mercifully Maya manages to take it off so slowly that he doesn't glimpse her pet before her phone rings again.&quot;;
