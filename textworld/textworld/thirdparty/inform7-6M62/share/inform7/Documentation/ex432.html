<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example story:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1607" -->

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1608" -->
<a id="c1608"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1609" -->
<a id="c1609"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1610" -->
<a id="c1610"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1611" -->
<a id="c1611"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An appraisal rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if we have taken the idol, say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1612" -->
<a id="c1612"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn273" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn273"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>follow </b>(rule)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_follow -->

<p>This phrase causes the rule to be obeyed immediately (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such). Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1613" -->
<a id="c1613"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
follow the advance time rule;
<br />follow the appraisal rulebook;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1614" -->
<a id="c1614"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn, stopping when one rule reaches an outcome; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.</p>
<p>When created, a rulebook starts out with no rules in it - in this example, of course, we quickly defined a couple of rules to go into it. But it's often the case in Inform that a rulebook exists without ever being stocked up, especially if the rulebook is for some obscure purpose never needed. The built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot;, applied to a rulebook, test whether any rule is present or not.</p>

<p>Because we've labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual.

<p>Because we've labelled all the fire rules, we could swap their order, or turn some of them off, while allowing the others run as usual. For instance, if there were a pair of fireproof gloves in the game, we might want to turn off the &quot;can't hold flaming objects rule&quot; whenever the player is wearing them.</p>
<p>This sort of flexibility is especially useful in the context of extensions. Someone writing an extension about burning would have no way of anticipating the need for a Fireproof Gauntlet of Thog, but the author would nonetheless be able to implement one easily.</p>
