<p class="sectionheading">ยง19.8. New rulebooks</p>
<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example story:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1607" -->
<a id="c1607"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('[=0x0022=]Appraisal[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1608" -->
<a id="c1608"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Passage is east of the Tomb. The green-eyed idol is in the Tomb. A Speak-Your-Progress machine is in the Passage.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1609" -->
<a id="c1609"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Appraisal rules is a rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1610" -->
<a id="c1610"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1611" -->
<a id="c1611"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An appraisal rule:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if we have taken the idol, say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1612" -->
<a id="c1612"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn273" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn273"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>follow </b>(rule)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_follow -->

<p>This phrase causes the rule to be obeyed immediately (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such). Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1613" -->
<a id="c1613"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
follow the advance time rule;
<br />follow the appraisal rulebook;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1614" -->
<a id="c1614"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn, stopping when one rule reaches an outcome; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.</p>
<p>When created, a rulebook starts out with no rules in it - in this example, of course, we quickly defined a couple of rules to go into it. But it's often the case in Inform that a rulebook exists without ever being stocked up, especially if the rulebook is for some obscure purpose never needed. The built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot;, applied to a rulebook, test whether any rule is present or not.</p>

<p>Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as &quot;Ben and Jerry enter from the south&quot;. The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:</p>

<p>Because so much of this game is randomized, it will not be possible to provide a test command that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they've all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.</p>
<p>This is also something that could get fairly slow if we added many more rooms and characters to it. In that case, we might want to select fast route-finding so that character movement won't take as long. This will cost memory, possibly forcing the game into Glulx format if it isn't already, but significantly reduce the run-time for large maps with numerous people moving each turn:</p>

<p>Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as &quot;Ben and Jerry enter from the south&quot;. The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:</p>

<p>Because so much of this game is randomized, it will not be possible to provide a test command that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they've all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.</p>
<p>This is also something that could get fairly slow if we added many more rooms and characters to it. In that case, we might want to select fast route-finding so that character movement won't take as long. This will cost memory, possibly forcing the game into Glulx format if it isn't already, but significantly reduce the run-time for large maps with numerous people moving each turn:</p>

<p>Now we try something a bit unusual. Inform on its own will report each action on its own line, so that each character who walks into or out of a room will be described in a separate paragraph. This is usually fine, but in a game with a lot of characters moving around simultaneously, it can become a bit overwhelming. Instead, we may want to condense these reports into a single line, such as &quot;Ben and Jerry enter from the south&quot;. The following accomplishes that goal by replacing some of the reporting rules, storing the information in a table, and then reading the table back later, once all the character movement has been resolved and the reports can usefully be collated:</p>

<p>Because so much of this game is randomized, it will not be possible to provide a test command that systematically solves it. A good strategy is to go to Main Street, get the syringe; go to the Town Hall and get the key; then visit the shops, inject everyone, and lock them in when they've all been injected. Then go to the Pool Hall, turn on the air conditioner, and wait for the remaining parties to show up.</p>
<p>This is also something that could get fairly slow if we added many more rooms and characters to it. In that case, we might want to select fast route-finding so that character movement won't take as long. This will cost memory, possibly forcing the game into Glulx format if it isn't already, but significantly reduce the run-time for large maps with numerous people moving each turn:</p>
