<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> When reading a command from the keyboard.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> Print the prompt text; wait for the player to type something and press return. Reject an entirely blank line, and treat a command beginning &quot;oops&quot; as a correction to the previous one. This is a fairly complicated business, so it is probably best not to change the &quot;for&quot; rules for this activity: &quot;before&quot;, and especially &quot;after&quot;, are another matter. (Note, however, that if Inform does reject a blank line and ask for another then this all happens inside the &quot;for&quot; rules: no &quot;after&quot; occurs after the blank line, nor does a &quot;before&quot; happen before the second attempt by the player. It is all a single round of the activity, not two.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) To lead absolute beginners in gently:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1551" -->
<a id="c1551"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before reading a command while the turn count is 1, say &quot;(This is your chance to say what the protagonist should do next. After the '&gt;', try typing 'take inventory'.)&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(b) The following responds politely but firmly if the player tries to type &quot;please look&quot;, say, instead of just &quot;look&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1552" -->
<a id="c1552"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('After reading a command:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command includes [=0x0022=]please[=0x0022=]:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=]Please do not say please.[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]reject the player[=0x0027=]s command.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Please do not say please.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;reject the player's command.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To explain. Fragments of what the player has typed are called snippets: &quot;the player's command&quot; is the entire thing. We can test if a snippet matches a given pattern like so:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn264" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn264"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> matches </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetmatches -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet exactly matches the specification. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1553" -->
<a id="c1553"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command matches &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true if the command is ROOM 101, but not if it's EXPLORE ROOM 7.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn265" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn265"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> does not match </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetdoesnotmatch -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet does not exactly match the specification.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn266" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn266"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> includes </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetincludes -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet includes words matching the specification, either at the beginning, in the middle, or at the end. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1554" -->
<a id="c1554"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command includes &quot;room [number]&quot;, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true if the command is ROOM 101, EXPLORE ROOM 7, or ROOM 22 AHOY, but not if it's VISIT ROOM GAMMA 7.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn267" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn267"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(snippet)<b> does not include </b>(topic)<b>:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_snippetdoesnotinclude -->

<p>This condition is true if the given snippet does not include any run of words which matches the specification.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Lastly, we took drastic action with another new phrase:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn268" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn268"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>reject the player's command</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_rejectcommand -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity. It tells Inform not to bother analysing the text further, but to go back to the keyboard. (No time passes; no turn elapses; nothing happens in the simulated world.)</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>(c) An improved version takes commands like &quot;please drop the coin&quot; and strips &quot;please&quot; from them, but then allows them to proceed normally:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1555" -->
<a id="c1555"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('After reading a command:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command includes [=0x0022=]please[=0x0022=]:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]say [=0x0022=](Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=][=0x0009=]cut the matched text.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;please&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;(Quelle politesse! But no need to say please.)&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Matched text&quot; is a snippet containing the words which matched against the pattern in the most recent &quot;includes&quot; condition, so in this case it contains just the single word &quot;please&quot;. Two phrases allow snippets to be altered:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn269" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn269"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>replace </b>(snippet)<b> with </b>(text)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_replacesnippet -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the snippet of command, usually the &quot;matched text&quot; found immediately before, with the given text. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1556" -->
<a id="c1556"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command includes &quot;room [number]&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the matched text with &quot;office&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn270" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn270"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>cut </b>(snippet)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_cutsnippet -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it removes the snippet of command. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1557" -->
<a id="c1557"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the player's command includes &quot;or else&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Note that &quot;replace&quot; and &quot;cut&quot; can only be used in &quot;after reading a command&quot; rules: not when an action has been chosen and has gone ahead into its rulebooks. Once the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity has finished, the command is final.</p>
<p>(d) To make the word &quot;grab&quot; an abbreviation for &quot;take all&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1558" -->
<a id="c1558"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('After reading a command:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the player[=0x0027=]s command matches [=0x0022=]grab[=0x0022=], replace the player[=0x0027=]s command with [=0x0022=]take all[=0x0022=].[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command matches &quot;grab&quot;, replace the player's command with &quot;take all&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(&quot;Snippet&quot; is actually a kind of value, so we could say &quot;Ah, you typed '[the player's command]'!&quot; or some such if we liked. But in practice only three snippets are likely to be useful: the two mentioned above, &quot;player's command&quot; and &quot;matched text&quot;, and the &quot;topic understood&quot;, used when matching the &quot;[text]&quot; token in command grammar.)</p>
<p>(e) Finally, we can make still more detailed alterations to the text of the command using the techniques presented in the Advanced Text chapter. For instance:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn271" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn271"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>change the text of the player's command to </b>(text)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_changecommand -->

<p>This phrase should be used only in &quot;after&quot; rules for the &quot;reading a command&quot; activity; it replaces the current command text entirely. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1559" -->
<a id="c1559"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let T be &quot;[the player's command]&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the regular expression &quot;\p&quot; in T with &quot;&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;change the text of the player's command to T.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This converts the player's command to text, which is then manipulated by searching for any punctuation mark and replacing it with blank text (that is, deleted), and then put back again as the new command.</p>

<!-- end definition -->

<p>It has sometimes been suggested that IF should allow for the player to use adverbs, so that doing something &quot;carefully&quot; will have a different effect from doing it &quot;quickly&quot;. There are several inherent challenges here: it's a good idea to make very sure the player knows all his adverb options, and the list of possibilities should probably not be too long.</p>
<p>Another trick is that adverbs complicate understanding commands, because they can occur anywhere: one might type &gt;GO WEST CAREFULLY or &gt;CAREFULLY GO WEST, and ideally the game should understand both. After reading a command is the best point to do this sort of thing, because we can find adverbs, interpret them, and remove them from the command stream. So:</p>
