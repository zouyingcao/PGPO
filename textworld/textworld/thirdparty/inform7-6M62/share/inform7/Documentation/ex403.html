<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.19. Random choices of things</p>
<p>Writing &quot;a random number&quot; is not allowed, because the possible range is too large, but that was the only reason why not.</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn89" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn89"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>a</b>/--<b> random </b>(description of values)<b> ... value</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_randomdesc -->

<p>This phrase makes a uniformly random choice from values satisfying the description given. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c629" -->
<a id="c629"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
a random visited room
<br />a random scene
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A problem message is issued if the range is too large (for instance, &quot;a random text&quot;). Unexpected results may follow if no value fits the description, unless we are describing objects, in which case the result is the special value &quot;nothing&quot;.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c630" -->
<a id="c630"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;You can see [number of adjacent rooms] way[s] from here; how about [random adjacent room]?&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But it's important to worry about the possibility that nothing qualifies - here, that no adjacent rooms exist. The above would then say:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c631" -->
<a id="c631"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see 0 ways from here; how about nothing?
</p></blockquote>
