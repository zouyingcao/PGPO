<p>Blank rows are useful because they enable us to add new data to a table. In effect, they are invisible when not used. A repeat loop like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1269" -->

repeat through Table 3:

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>automatically skips blank rows, so it would initially do nothing at all. Similarly, choosing a &quot;random&quot; row will never choose a blank one.</p>
<p>A convenient way to test if a table contains non-blank rows is to use the built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot;. So:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1270" -->
<a id="c1270"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>tests whether all of its rows are blank; if even one cell contains a value then the table is &quot;non-empty&quot;.</p>
