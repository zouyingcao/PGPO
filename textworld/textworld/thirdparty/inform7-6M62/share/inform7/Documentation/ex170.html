<p>As might be guessed, this applies when the action takes place in the same location as the person named: and of course that person can also be described more vaguely (&quot;... in the presence of a woman&quot;, say), and can just as easily be an inanimate thing (&quot;... in the presence of the radio set&quot;).</p>

<p>The last of the optional clauses we can tack on to the description of an action is the most general of all. We can add &quot;when&quot; and then any condition at all, as in:</p>

<p>Notice that we have two rules that apply to &quot;searching the desk&quot;, but one of them has a more specific set of parameters (&quot;when the envelope is lost&quot;). This means that Inform will consult that rule first and use it if it applies; it will only carry out our plain vanilla &quot;instead of searching the desk&quot; rule when the more restricted rule is not relevant.</p>
