<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.13. Going from, going to</p>
<p>Going is an action defined like any other: it is the one which happens when the player tries to go from one location to another. But it is unlike other actions because it happens in two locations, not just one, and has other complications such as vehicles and doors to contend with. To make it easier to write legible and flexible rules, &quot;going&quot; is allowed to be described in a number of special ways not open to other actions, as demonstrated by the following example story:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c513" -->
<a id="c513"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c514" -->
<a id="c514"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of going nowhere from the Front Stacks, say &quot;Bookcases obstruct almost all passages out of here.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c515" -->
<a id="c515"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c516" -->
<a id="c516"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going to the Catalogue Room, say &quot;You emerge back into the Catalogue Room.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that &quot;going nowhere&quot; means trying a map connection which is blank, and if no rules intervene then &quot;You can't go that way&quot; is normally printed. Unless &quot;nowhere&quot; is specified, descriptions of going apply only when there is a map connection. So &quot;going from the Musicology Section&quot; would not match if the player were trying to go east from there, since there is no map connection to the east. Similarly, &quot;going somewhere&quot; excludes blank connections.</p>
<p>The places gone &quot;from&quot; or &quot;to&quot; can be specific named regions instead of rooms. This is convenient when there are several different ways into or out of an area of map but a common rule needs to apply to all: so, for example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c517" -->
<a id="c517"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going from the Cultivated Land to the Wilderness, ...
<br />Before going nowhere from the Wilderness, say &quot;Tangled brush forces you back.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that it must be &quot;going nowhere from the Wilderness&quot;, not &quot;...in the Wilderness&quot;. (Note also the caveat that the regions must be named: &quot;going from a region&quot;, or something similarly nonspecific, will not work.)</p>
<p>An important point about &quot;going... from&quot; is that, as mentioned in general terms above, it requires that there is actually a map connection that way: whereas &quot;going... in&quot; does not. Suppose there is no map connection north from the Wilderness. Then:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c518" -->
<a id="c518"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of going north from the Wilderness, say &quot;You'll never read this.&quot;
<br />Instead of going north in the Wilderness, say &quot;Oh, it's too cold.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The first of these never happens, because it is logically impossible to go north from the Wilderness: but the second does happen. (Technically, this is because &quot;going north&quot; is the action, and &quot;in the Wilderness&quot; a separate condition tacked onto the rule.) This distinction is often useful - it allows us to write rules which apply only to feasible movements.</p>
<p>This may be a good place to mention a small restriction on the ways we can specify an action for a rule to apply to, and how it can be overcome. The restriction is that the action should only involve constant quantities, so that the following does not work:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c519" -->
<a id="c519"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Dome is a room. The Hutch is north of the Dome. The rabbit is in the Hutch. Before going to the location of the rabbit, say &quot;You pick up a scent!&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because &quot;the location of the rabbit&quot; is a quantity which changes in play (the player can pick up the rabbit and take him to the Dome, for instance). However, we can get around this restriction by defining a suitable adjective, like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c520" -->
<a id="c520"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Dome is a room. The Hutch is north of the Dome. The rabbit is in the Hutch. Definition: a room is rabbit-infested if it is the location of the rabbit. Before going to a rabbit-infested room, say &quot;You pick up a scent!&quot;
