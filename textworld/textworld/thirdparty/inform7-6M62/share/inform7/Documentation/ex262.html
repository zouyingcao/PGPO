<p class="sectionheading">ยง18.31. Asking which do you mean</p>
<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> When the player has typed an ambiguous noun reference, and Inform has not been able to decide what was meant.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> A question such as &quot;Which do you mean, the laminated mahogany box or the boom box?&quot; is printed. (This activity shapes the question: it is not responsible for parsing the answer. It would be very mysterious to write rules for this activity such that nothing is printed, because the player would then have no idea what to type.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> The question is harder to print than may first appear, since one must not simply list the options, but also take into account collections of plural objects (&quot;Which do you mean, the gold-tipped pen or a gold coin?&quot;). It is probably better not to try to rewrite this.</p>
<p>(a) But we can place notes before or after: here is a verbose explanation for beginners to IF.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1544" -->
<a id="c1544"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before asking which do you mean: say &quot;Okay, so I'm going to have to ask a question now: you've typed something ambiguous, and I don't know which noun you're referring to.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1545" -->
<a id="c1545"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After asking which do you mean: say &quot;(Just type a word or two to give me more information.)&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(b) We can also use this activity as a context for other activities. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1546" -->
<a id="c1546"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Champs du Mars is a room. The great Eiffel Tower is here. &quot;The great Tower stands high over you.&quot; The souvenir model Eiffel Tower is here. &quot;Comparatively tiny is the souvenir version.&quot; The great Eiffel Tower is fixed in place. Understand &quot;actual&quot; as the great Tower.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1547" -->
<a id="c1547"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of the great Tower while asking which do you mean: say &quot;actual Tower&quot;. Rule for printing the name of the souvenir tower while asking which do you mean: say &quot;souvenir&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>causes TAKE TOWER (for instance) to produce a nice tidy question in reply: &quot;Which do you mean, the actual Tower or the souvenir?&quot;</p>
<p><span class="boldface">4. A note about actions.</span> This activity takes place during the process of understanding the player's command, when the action that will take place is not fully known. So if the player types &quot;TAKE SHOEBOX&quot;, this activity would happen when SHOEBOX is being examined for meaning. Inform knows that the action will be taking, but nothing else. That means attaching a proviso like &quot;... while taking a container&quot; to a rule for this activity will cause the rule to have no effect - whereas &quot;... while taking&quot; would be fine.</p>
