<p>Not all characters are friendly, and there are times when we may want to include a fight sequence. There are a number of ways to approach this, depending on whether we want to offer the player a random outcome, a predetermined one, or a combat sequence that depends partly on strategy or on having the proper equipment.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Lanista 1</span> demonstrates randomized combat in the style of a role-playing game. The player has a partially random chance of doing any given amount of damage; both the player and his opponent have hit points, and whichever one runs out first dies. <span class="boldface">Lanista 2</span> continues this idea, but includes weapons that affect the amount of of damage done. <span class="boldface">Red Cross</span> by itself implements a command that we might use to find out how strong characters are at the moment.</p>
<p>A word of warning about designing such sequences: a player who gets a roll he doesn't like always has the option of UNDOing a turn and re-rolling. This means that he can always win a random battle sooner or later; bad luck only means that it takes him longer (so he gets more bored and irritated as he plays through). It is possible to turn off UNDO implementation with</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23697" -->
<a id="c23697"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use UNDO prevention.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...but there is a good chance that this will irritate players in itself. Role-playing-style combat scenarios need careful design, lest they actively make a story less fun.</p>
<p>In a slightly more realistic setting, combat leaves physical remains behind, unless we're wielding some kind of futuristic weapon that evaporates our opponents entirely: <span class="boldface">Puff of Orange Smoke</span> demonstrates characters who leave corpses behind when they die, while <span class="boldface">Technological Terror</span> more tamely explodes robots into numerous component parts.</p>
<p>Finally, we can imagine some scenarios in which, instead of allowing characters to strike at each other for random damage, we want to introduce an element of strategy. <span class="boldface">Don Pedro's Revenge</span> shows the rudiments of a system in which the characters can make different kinds of attack depending on where they are in a room filled with perches, barrels, and other swashbuckler props.</p>
