<p class="sectionheading">ยง3.18. Articles and proper names</p>
<p>Suppose we have said that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c145" -->
<a id="c145"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Ballroom is a man called Mr Darcy.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When the Ballroom is visited, the man is listed in the description of the room as &quot;Mr Darcy&quot;, not as &quot;a Mr Darcy&quot;. This happened not because Inform recognised that Darcy is a proper name, or even because men tend to have proper names, but because Inform noticed that we did not use &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;the&quot; or &quot;some&quot; in the sentence which created him. The following shows most of the options:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c146" -->
<a id="c146"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Belfry is a room. A bat is in the Belfry. The bell is in the Belfry. Some woodworm are in the Belfry. A man called William Snelson is in the Belfry. A woman called the sexton's wife is in the Belfry. A man called a bellringer is in the Belfry.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c147" -->
<a id="c147"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Belfry is a man called the vicar. The indefinite article of the vicar is &quot;your local&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In the resulting story, we read:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c148" -->
<a id="c148"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see a bat, a bell, some woodworm, William Snelson, the sexton's wife, a bellringer and your local vicar here.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The subtlest rule here is in the handling of &quot;the&quot;. We wrote &quot;The bell is in the Belfry&quot;, but this did not result in the bell always being called &quot;the&quot; bell: in fact, writing &quot;A bell is in the Belfry&quot; would have had the same effect. On the other hand, &quot;A woman called the sexton's wife is in the Belfry.&quot; led to the wife always being known as &quot;the&quot; sexton's wife, not &quot;a&quot; sexton's wife, because Inform thinks the choice of article after &quot;called&quot; shows more of our intention than it would elsewhere. These rules will never be perfect in all situations, so we are also allowed to specify indefinite articles by hand, as the vicar's case shows.</p>
<p>&quot;Some&quot; is worth a closer look, because English uses it in several different ways. By introducing the woodworm with &quot;some&quot;, above, we established that it was plural. We might imagine that there are many worms, even though they are represented by a single thing in Inform. We can expect to see text in the story such as:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c149" -->
<a id="c149"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see some woodworm here.
<br />The woodworm are fixed in place.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But suppose we wanted something which there is an amount of, but which is not made up of individual items - a so-called mass noun like &quot;water&quot;, or &quot;bread&quot;. Now we can write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c150" -->
<a id="c150"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The water is here. The indefinite article is &quot;some&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and this time Inform does not treat the &quot;some water&quot; thing as a plural, so we might read:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c151" -->
<a id="c151"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
You can see some water here.
<br />The water is hardly portable.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>rather than &quot;The water are hardly portable.&quot;</p>
<p>Finally, we can override these settings, if they still come out not as we intend, by explicitly changing the either/or properties &quot;singular-named&quot; (vs &quot;plural-named&quot;) and &quot;proper-named&quot; (vs &quot;improper-named&quot;).</p>
