<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.4. Money</p>
<p>Money could be anything which the two people in a bargain both agree is valuable. Here, the player and an ogre agree on a copper coin as money:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23724" -->
<a id="c23724"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player carries a copper coin. The ogre carries a rock cake. The cake is edible.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23725" -->
<a id="c23725"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of giving the coin to the ogre:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the ogre carries the coin;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the player carries the cake;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;The ogre grunts and hands you a rock cake.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now Inform does provide an action, &quot;buying&quot;, and a command for it, BUY, but they ordinarily respond simply &quot;Nothing is on sale.&quot; This is no longer true, so we should make BUY CAKE work. The difficulty here is that a command like BUY CAKE does not specify what should be handed over in exchange. Here we just check that the player has the coin, but in principle we could check for any of a range of monetary tokens - coins, notes, cheque book, debit card, and so on.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23726" -->
<a id="c23726"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of buying the cake:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player has the coin, try giving the coin to the ogre;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise say &quot;You have no money.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In more advanced economies, where shopping replaces barter, the seller will stock a wide range of differently priced goods. For a tabulated catalogue of wares, see <span class="boldface">Introduction to Juggling</span>: to allow the player to negotiate prices, see <span class="boldface">Money for Nothing</span>. In both of those examples, the player's current financial worth is simulated only as a current total amount of money carried - say, $2.50. This is typical, because in most situations what matters is how much money is in the pocket, not how it is made up. Money behaves more like a liquid than a set of items: hence terms like &quot;liquidity&quot;, &quot;cash flow&quot; or <span class="boldface">Frozen Assets</span> - the name of the simplest example demonstrating this. If we really need a comprehensive simulation down to pieces of currency - where it makes a difference carrying four quarters rather than a dollar bill, because the quarters can be fed into a vending machine - see <span class="boldface">Nickel and Dimed</span>.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Fabrication</span> takes the problem in a different direction, making calculations about the cost of a new garment based on the price of the pattern, the quantity of fabric required, and the value of the fabric type chosen -- showing off what we can do with unit multiplication in Inform.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Widget Enterprises</span> explores the challenge of pricing widgets for maximum profit, given certain necessary costs and customers with varying willingness to pay.</p>

<p>We've skipped over defining what makes a denomination the best for a given transaction, so we'd better do that now. Our goal is to avoid ever having the player gratuitously overpay -- he should always offer the smallest amount of money that will meet the price of what he's buying.</p>
<p>We also assume that all money &quot;enclosed by the buyer&quot; -- that is, somewhere in the buyer's possession -- is available for use. This might not be true in a game where the player could pick up, say, a sealed lucite container with a ten-dollar bill inside; in that case we would have to define our terms more rigorously, perhaps by requiring that the bills be both enclosed and touchable by the buyer. The touchability check adds an extra layer of calculation, however, and since it is not necessary in this example (and probably not in most other cases either), we'll leave it out:</p>

<p>We've skipped over defining what makes a denomination the best for a given transaction, so we'd better do that now. Our goal is to avoid ever having the player gratuitously overpay -- he should always offer the smallest amount of money that will meet the price of what he's buying.</p>
<p>We also assume that all money &quot;enclosed by the buyer&quot; -- that is, somewhere in the buyer's possession -- is available for use. This might not be true in a game where the player could pick up, say, a sealed lucite container with a ten-dollar bill inside; in that case we would have to define our terms more rigorously, perhaps by requiring that the bills be both enclosed and touchable by the buyer. The touchability check adds an extra layer of calculation, however, and since it is not necessary in this example (and probably not in most other cases either), we'll leave it out:</p>
