<p>Occasionally we would like to change the way the name of something is printed as part of our inventory, and we can do this with a printing the name rule such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23679" -->
<a id="c23679"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of the dead rat while taking inventory:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;dead rat (at arm's length)&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>There are also several possibilities for redesigning the inventory list as a whole. <span class="boldface">Persephone</span> shows how to divide an inventory list into two parts, a &quot;You are carrying: &quot; section and a &quot;You are wearing: &quot; section. <span class="boldface">Equipment List</span> goes further, and shows how we might use Inform's specialized listing functions to create a variety of differently formatted inventories.</p>
<p>Sometimes the way Inform by default lists properties such as &quot;(closed)&quot; or &quot;(open but empty)&quot; isn't quite what we want. <span class="boldface">Oyster Wide Shut</span> offers a flexible alternative to the standard behavior, allowing finer control over which properties are listed and how they are described.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Trying Taking Manhattan</span> replaces the inventory behavior for other characters: instead of silently looking through their possessions (but not describing them to the player), they now describe to the player what they're carrying and wearing.</p>

<p>As we've seen in earlier examples such as &quot;Equipment List&quot;, it is possible to vary the way Inform creates inventory listings in general (to create lists that look more like paragraphs of prose, lists divided between what the player is wearing and what he isn't, and so on). We can also use activities to alter the printing of specific objects' names and contents, as with the &quot;omit contents in listing&quot; feature after printing the name of something.</p>
<p>We may find, however, that we would like a great deal more control over Inform's printing of inventory details, not just as a special effect for a few items, but throughout the game.</p>
<p>We start by turning off Inform's native property writer:</p>

<p>As we've seen in earlier examples such as &quot;Equipment List&quot;, it is possible to vary the way Inform creates inventory listings in general (to create lists that look more like paragraphs of prose, lists divided between what the player is wearing and what he isn't, and so on). We can also use activities to alter the printing of specific objects' names and contents, as with the &quot;omit contents in listing&quot; feature after printing the name of something.</p>
<p>We may find, however, that we would like a great deal more control over Inform's printing of inventory details, not just as a special effect for a few items, but throughout the game.</p>
<p>We start by turning off Inform's native property writer:</p>
