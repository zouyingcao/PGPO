<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.5. Examining</p>
<p>By default, examining an object shows its description, and - for devices - tells us whether the object is switched on or switched off.</p>
<p>This kind of additional information is not always what we want, so if we have a device whose on/off status we want to conceal, we may write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23678" -->
<a id="c23678"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The examine described devices rule is not listed in any rulebook.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>On the other hand, there are times when we may want to add a similar line or two to the descriptions of other kinds of objects. <span class="boldface">Crusoe</span> allows us to append an &quot;It is charred.&quot; sentence to the end of descriptions of things we have burned in the fire. Since it works by introducing a &quot;printing the description&quot; activity, Crusoe is also a good example to start from if we want to introduce more complex, flexible descriptions of items throughout our story.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Odin</span> rewrites the &quot;You see nothing special...&quot; line with other text of our own, for items that otherwise do not have a description.</p>
<p>Finally, we may want to look at multiple things at once. <span class="boldface">The Left Hand of Autumn</span> demonstrates how we might provide a different response for EXAMINE PAINTINGS than for examining each individually; <span class="boldface">Beekeeper's Apprentice</span> provides a SEARCH command that will show the descriptions of all the scenery in the current location.</p>
