<p>We often want to arrange for something to happen at some point in the future. Here is yet another timepiece:</p>

<!-- START CODE "c670" -->
<a id="c670"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;It begins to mark time.&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The event here is called &quot;the egg-timer clucks&quot;. It only happens if we instruct so, using one of the following phrases:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn108" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn108"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(rule)<b> in </b>(time)<b> from now</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_timefromnow -->

<p>This phrase causes the given rule to be run at a given time offset from the current time of day. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c672" -->
<a id="c672"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the egg-timer clucks in 18 minutes from now;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn109" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn109"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(rule)<b> in </b>(number)<b> turn</b>/turns<b> from now</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_turnsfromnow -->

<p>This phrase causes the given rule to be run at a given number of turns after the current one. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c673" -->
<a id="c673"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the egg-timer clucks in four turns from now;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn110" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn110"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b></b>(rule)<b> at </b>(time)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_attime -->

<p>This phrase causes the given rule to be run at a given time of day. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c674" -->
<a id="c674"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the egg-timer clucks at 11:35 AM;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>If we know in advance what time we want something to happen, we can more simply write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c675" -->
<a id="c675"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
At 4 PM: say &quot;The great bells of the clock tower chime four.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Note that in either case such rules begin with the word &quot;at&quot;: they are the only rules allowed to begin with the word &quot;at&quot;.)</p>
<p>A small warning: timed events like these only have a chance to occur during the turn sequence, that is, once every turn. In most stories, one turn takes one minute, so there will in due course be a turn happening at exactly (say) 11:35 AM. But if the clock is being advanced faster than this, it's possible that there are turns at (say) 11:32 AM and then not until 11:37 AM. But an event set for 11:35 AM will nevertheless happen -- it will run at the first available turn after that time, which will be 11:37 AM. Events can thus happen up to half an hour late, though Inform cancels them if the elapsed time is greater than that.</p>
<p>The Scenes panel of the Index can be a useful way to see what events have been set.</p>
