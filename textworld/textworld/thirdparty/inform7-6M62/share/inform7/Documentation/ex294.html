<p class="sectionheading">ยง21.10. Lengthening or shortening a list</p>
<p>We can explicitly change the length of a list like so:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn348" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn348"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>change </b>(list of values)<b> to have </b>(number)<b> entries</b>/entry</p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_changelength -->

<p>This phrase alters the given list so that it now has exactly the number of entries given. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1807" -->
<a id="c1807"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
change L to have 21 entries;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>If L previously had more than 21 entries, they are thrown away (and lost forever); if L previously had fewer, then new entries are created, using the default value for whatever kind of value L holds. So extending a list of numbers will pad it out with 0s, but extending a list of texts will pad it out with the empty text &quot;&quot;, and so on.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We can also write the equivalent phrases:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn349" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn349"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>truncate </b>(list of values)<b> to </b>(number)<b> entries</b>/entry</p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_truncate -->

<p>This phrase alters the given list so that it now has no more than the number of entries given. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1808" -->
<a id="c1808"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
truncate L to 8 entries;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>shortens L to length 8 if it is currently longer than that, trimming entries from the end, but would (for instance) leave a list of length 3 unchanged. Note that</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1809" -->
<a id="c1809"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
truncate L to 0 entries;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>empties it to { }, the list with nothing in.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn350" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn350"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>truncate </b>(list of values)<b> to the first </b>(number)<b> entries</b>/entry</p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_truncatefirst -->

<p>This phrase alters the given list so that it now consists only of the initial part of the list with the given length. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1810" -->
<a id="c1810"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
truncate L to the first 4 entries;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>turns {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11} to {1, 3, 5, 7}.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn351" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn351"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>truncate </b>(list of values)<b> to the last </b>(number)<b> entries</b>/entry</p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_truncatelast -->

<p>This phrase alters the given list so that it now consists only of the final part of the list with the given length. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1811" -->
<a id="c1811"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
truncate L to the last 4 entries;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>turns {1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11} to {5, 7, 9, 11}.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>But we don't have to truncate: we can also -</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn352" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn352"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>extend </b>(list of values)<b> to </b>(number)<b> entries</b>/entry</p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_extend -->

<p>This phrase pads out the list with default values as needed so that it now has at least the given length. (If the list is already at least that length, nothing is done.) Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1812" -->
<a id="c1812"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
extend L to 80 entries;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>lengthens L to length 80 if it is currently shorter than that.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>For example,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1813" -->
<a id="c1813"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To check sorting (N - a number):
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;let L be a list of numbers;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;extend L to N entries;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;repeat with X running from 1 to N:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now entry X of L is X;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;L unrandomised is [L].&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sort L in random order;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;L randomised is [L].&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;sort L;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;L in ascending order is [L].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>builds a list of N numbers (initially all 0), fills it with the numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., N, then randomly reorders them, then sorts them back again, recovering the original order. The text produced by &quot;check sorting 10&quot; depends partly on chance but might for instance be:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1814" -->
<a id="c1814"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
L unrandomised is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
<br />L randomised is 6, 2, 9, 3, 10, 1, 7, 4, 8 and 5.
<br />L in ascending order is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As with text in the previous chapter, a project which needs really long lists should use the Glulx virtual machine - &quot;check sorting 10000&quot;, for instance, would break the default memory environment on the Z-machine, which is very tight, but works fine (if not very rapidly) on Glulx.</p>

<p>Occasionally it happens that we want to process an action on multiple items differently than we would if the player had just typed each of the individual actions separately. In this example, the reason is that we can only successfully GIVE items when their combined value passes a certain threshold amount; otherwise the recipient will reject them.</p>
<p>This works as an implementation of money, if we give value only to cash objects (though several other implementations of cash are available, most of which are simpler and more efficient). We could also imagine a mechanic like this being used for a bargaining or auction game as well, given a society that deals in objects rather than credits.</p>
<p>In order to consider all the items in the gift at once, we create an action that applies to multiple objects, but will in fact test the whole object collection during the first pass and print a definitive answer to whether the action succeeded. All subsequent times the game consults the rulebook will be stopped at the very beginning. No further processing will occur or output be printed.</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A subtlety here: we say &quot;things preferably held&quot; to prefer items that the player is holding (so if the player has two dollars in hand and a third lies on the ground, he will use just the two he has).</p>
<p>The second grammar line allows Inform to match things that aren't held if it can't make up the list from things that are. If all three dollars are on the ground, the player can pick them up before spending them.</p>
<p>We do not, however, make multiply-giving apply to a &quot;carried&quot; item, because that will generate implicit takes of those items in a way that will mess up our action reporting. Instead, we're going to build the implicit takes into the system in a different way, one that permits us to collate the reports more attractively and print a short, one-sentence list of anything that the player had to pick up.</p>

<p>Occasionally it happens that we want to process an action on multiple items differently than we would if the player had just typed each of the individual actions separately. In this example, the reason is that we can only successfully GIVE items when their combined value passes a certain threshold amount; otherwise the recipient will reject them.</p>
<p>This works as an implementation of money, if we give value only to cash objects (though several other implementations of cash are available, most of which are simpler and more efficient). We could also imagine a mechanic like this being used for a bargaining or auction game as well, given a society that deals in objects rather than credits.</p>
<p>In order to consider all the items in the gift at once, we create an action that applies to multiple objects, but will in fact test the whole object collection during the first pass and print a definitive answer to whether the action succeeded. All subsequent times the game consults the rulebook will be stopped at the very beginning. No further processing will occur or output be printed.</p>

<p>A subtlety here: we say &quot;things preferably held&quot; to prefer items that the player is holding (so if the player has two dollars in hand and a third lies on the ground, he will use just the two he has).</p>

<p>PURLOIN, used in the tests here, is a special debugging command that allows the player to acquire objects that wouldn't otherwise be possible to take. It is only active in non-release versions of the story. For more about debugging commands, see the chapter on Testing and Debugging.</p>

<p>Occasionally it happens that we want to process an action on multiple items differently than we would if the player had just typed each of the individual actions separately. In this example, the reason is that we can only successfully GIVE items when their combined value passes a certain threshold amount; otherwise the recipient will reject them.</p>
<p>This works as an implementation of money, if we give value only to cash objects (though several other implementations of cash are available, most of which are simpler and more efficient). We could also imagine a mechanic like this being used for a bargaining or auction game as well, given a society that deals in objects rather than credits.</p>
<p>In order to consider all the items in the gift at once, we create an action that applies to multiple objects, but will in fact test the whole object collection during the first pass and print a definitive answer to whether the action succeeded. All subsequent times the game consults the rulebook will be stopped at the very beginning. No further processing will occur or output be printed.</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A subtlety here: we say &quot;things preferably held&quot; to prefer items that the player is holding (so if the player has two dollars in hand and a third lies on the ground, he will use just the two he has).</p>
<p>The second grammar line allows Inform to match things that aren't held if it can't make up the list from things that are. If all three dollars are on the ground, the player can pick them up before spending them.</p>
<p>We do not, however, make multiply-giving apply to a &quot;carried&quot; item, because that will generate implicit takes of those items in a way that will mess up our action reporting. Instead, we're going to build the implicit takes into the system in a different way, one that permits us to collate the reports more attractively and print a short, one-sentence list of anything that the player had to pick up.</p>

<p>The bit about making some items &quot;marked for listing&quot;, above, rather than printing the list directly, is that using the &quot;[the list of....]&quot; syntax guarantees that Inform will respect grouping rules in writing its description.
