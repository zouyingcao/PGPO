<p class="sectionheading">ยง23.13. Writing and reading tables to external files</p>
<p>The main use for files is to store and retrieve data, and the most flexible form of data used by Inform is the Table, so facilities are provided which make it as easy as possible to write and read the contents of a table to files. If so, the file must contain just one single table: so to write multiple tables, we need to write multiple files, one for each.</p>
<p>To save the contents of a table to a file, we use the phrase:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn369" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn369"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>write </b>(external file)<b> from </b>(table name)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_writetable -->

<p>This phrase causes the entire contents of the given table to be written out to the given file. Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1919" -->
<a id="c1919"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
write File of Glaciation Data from the Table of Antarctic Reserves
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Any blank rows in the table are automatically moved to the bottom, and only the non-blank rows are written.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>To load a file back into a table,</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn370" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn370"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>read </b>(external file)<b> into </b>(table name)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_readtable -->

<p>This phrase causes the entire contents of the given table to be read in from the given file. Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1920" -->
<a id="c1920"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
read File of Glaciation Data into the Table of Antarctic Reserves
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Any rows left spare at the foot of the table are automatically blanked. On the other hand if the file is too large to fit into the table - with too many columns or too many rows - a run-time problem is produced.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>We can check if a file already exists using:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn371" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn371"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>if </b>(external file)<b> exists:</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_fileexists -->

<p>This condition is true if the file-system used by the player appears to contain a file with the right name. For example, if we declared:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1921" -->
<a id="c1921"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The binary File of Glaciation Data is called &quot;icedata&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and then tested</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1922" -->
<a id="c1922"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the File of Glaciation Data exists, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then Inform would search for a file called &quot;icedata&quot;. (The arrangements for where this might be stored, and its filename extension, vary from platform to platform.)</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>One unfortunate restriction must be kept in mind. Some of what is stored in tables is solid information whose meaning never changes: the number 342, for instance, means the same to everyone. But other information depends entirely on the current location of certain structures in memory - for instance, a rule is internally referred to by its memory location. This potentially changes each time Go or Replay is clicked, and so it is not safe to pass it from one copy to another, or from one project to another. The only tables which Inform allows us to write into files are those containing &quot;safe&quot; data: numbers, units, times of day and kinds of value with named alternatives. Scenes, rules or rulebooks, in particular, are not allowed.</p>
