<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.2. Awarding points</p>
<p>Traditionally-written stories award points throughout play, as an indication of progress. If we want to be traditional, we must first write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c633" -->
<a id="c633"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use scoring.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Without this, the SCORE, NOTIFY ON and NOTIFY OFF commands do not work; the final score is not shown at the end of a story; and the status line above the player's text area shows only the turn count, not (as is more usual) both the score and the turn count. Changing the &quot;score&quot; (see below) has no visible effect, though it is not actually illegal.</p>
<p>With &quot;Use scoring&quot; in place, we can award points as follows:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c634" -->
<a id="c634"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
increase the score by 5;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>substituting whatever number we feel is appropriate. We should be careful not to give out the same points over and over, that is, not to reward the same basic achievement many times over if the player simply repeats the same action. This, for instance, is open to abuse:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c635" -->
<a id="c635"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After taking the trophy:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;increase the score by 5;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Well done!&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The player may simply take the trophy, drop it again, take it again, ... and win five points every time around. We can prevent this by phrasing the rule more carefully:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c636" -->
<a id="c636"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After taking the trophy when the trophy is not handled:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;increase the score by 5;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Well done!&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Rather than being an open-ended scoring system, IF normally has a maximum possible score, which can be specified with a sentence like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c637" -->
<a id="c637"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The maximum score is 10.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The score and maximum score are just numbers that vary, so we can freely change them:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c638" -->
<a id="c638"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After eating the poisoned mushroom:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the score is -100.
</p></blockquote>
