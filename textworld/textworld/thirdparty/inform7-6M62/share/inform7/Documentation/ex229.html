<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.4. Defining new adjectives</p>
<p>Suppose we want to coin a word for supporters currently supporting something. We can do so with the following sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c387" -->
<a id="c387"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A supporter is occupied if something is on it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note the colon, which is essential, and the usage of &quot;it&quot; in the definition part to refer to the object in question. (For this purpose we would write &quot;it&quot; even if we were defining a term about, say, a woman instead of a supporter, so that &quot;she&quot; or &quot;her&quot; might seem more appropriate - but see below.)</p>
<p>This creates the adjective &quot;occupied&quot;, and gives it a definition valid for supporters. That restriction on validity means that non-supporters would always fail the description &quot;something occupied&quot;; which might be unfortunate if we wanted to talk about rooms being occupied. We could give a second definition thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c388" -->
<a id="c388"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A room is occupied if a person is in it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>These are entirely different senses of the word &quot;occupied&quot; - a mantelpiece is occupied if an invitation is on it, but for a drawing room to be occupied there must be human presence - and Inform applies whichever sense is relevant when deciding whether or not a given object is &quot;occupied&quot;.</p>
<p>Often, though not always, we also want to give a name to the opposite possibility. We can do that as follows:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c389" -->
<a id="c389"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: A room is occupied rather than unoccupied if a person is in it.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The &quot;rather than...&quot; part of the definition is optional, but it saves having to write a boringly similar definition of &quot;unoccupied&quot; out in longhand. (Note that Inform does not guess the meaning of &quot;unoccupied&quot; unless it has been explicitly told it. Such guesses are too risky, when so many &quot;un-&quot; words fail to conform to this pattern: &quot;unified&quot;, &quot;uncle&quot;, &quot;ungulate&quot; and so on.)</p>
<p>Newly defined adjectives cannot be used when creating things, because they are not explicit enough. Inform could not satisfy:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c390" -->
<a id="c390"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Ballroom is occupied. The bucket is a large container.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because there is not enough information: by whom is the Ballroom occupied? How large, exactly? On the other hand, newly defined adjectives are very helpful in conditions and for rules, as we shall see later on.</p>
<p>It is occasionally clumsy having to refer to the subject of a definition using &quot;it&quot;. We can avoid this and give the definition better legibility by supplying a name instead. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c391" -->
<a id="c391"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a direction (called thataway) is viable if the room thataway from the location is a room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which is a good deal easier to read than</p>
<!-- START CODE "c392" -->
<a id="c392"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Definition: a direction is viable if the room it from the location is a room.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
