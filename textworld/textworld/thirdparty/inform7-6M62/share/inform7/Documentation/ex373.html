<p>We have already seen, in the chapter on Descriptions which is a forerunner of this one, that Inform provides not only &quot;adjacent&quot; as a way of seeing if one room is directly connected to another, but also &quot;the best route from A to B&quot;, which allows us to see if any sequence of moves connects them.</p>
<p>Something similar - in fact, simpler - is allowed for any relation between objects. Suppose we would like to go sledging: we can go downhill, but not up. Some quite distant places may be reachable, while others close by may not be, even if lower than us, because they would involve climbing again at some point. The following would implement this:</p>

<p>This phrase tries to find the length of a shortest route between the two given endpoints, using the given relation of objects to determine single steps. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c982" -->
<a id="c982"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The result is 0 if the two endpoints are the same, or -1 if no route exists.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Another example would be the &quot;six degrees of separation&quot; game, where it is claimed that any two people on Earth are connected by a sequence of up to six acquaintances. In an Inform implementation, we might talk about &quot;the next step via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein&quot;, for instance, a phrase likely to evaluate to Donald Rumsfeld, and then</p>
<!-- START CODE "c983" -->
<a id="c983"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
the number of steps via the friendship relation from George Bush to Saddam Hussein
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>would be... but that would be telling.</p>
<p>As with route-finding through the map, finding &quot;the next step via&quot; a relation can be slow. For instance, suppose we have dozens of articles of clothing all partially revealing each other, connected by two relations - overlying and underlying. Then &quot;the next step via&quot; these relations allows us to establish what can be worn on top of what else. If we need to calculate this often, and there are enormous wardrobes of clothes to choose from, speed starts to matter.</p>
<p>Once again there is a choice of algorithms: &quot;fast&quot; and &quot;slow&quot;, where &quot;fast&quot; needs much more memory. To make route-finding for a given relation &quot;fast&quot;, we have to declare it that way:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c984" -->
<a id="c984"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Overlying relates various garments to various garments with fast route-finding.
<br />Overlapping relates various garments to each other with fast route-finding.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Otherwise, the &quot;slow&quot; method will be used.</p>
<p>This &quot;with fast route-finding&quot; note can only be added to various-to-various relations. (Although route-finding through various-to-one and one-to-various relations is fully supported, it exploits the relative simplicity of these problems to use a more efficient algorithm than either &quot;fast&quot; or &quot;slow&quot;.)</p>
