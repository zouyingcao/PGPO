<p>Very occasionally, for out-of-the-ordinary games, we want to make major changes to the way that Inform ordinarily understands commands.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Cloves</span> shows how we might read adverbs in the player's command: adverbs are challenging because they can legitimately appear anywhere in a command structure, so must be found and accounted for before the rest of the command is understood.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Fragment of a Greek Tragedy</span> goes further, substituting a keyword-recognition parser for the usual structure of commands and objects.</p>
<p>Less drastically, menus of numbered options can temporarily replace or augment standard commands. <span class="boldface">Down in Oodville</span> demonstrates how to add a list of transporter destinations from which the player may choose by numeral.</p>

<p>It has sometimes been suggested that IF should allow for the player to use adverbs, so that doing something &quot;carefully&quot; will have a different effect from doing it &quot;quickly&quot;. There are several inherent challenges here: it's a good idea to make very sure the player knows all his adverb options, and the list of possibilities should probably not be too long.</p>
<p>Another trick is that adverbs complicate understanding commands, because they can occur anywhere: one might type &gt;GO WEST CAREFULLY or &gt;CAREFULLY GO WEST, and ideally the game should understand both.
