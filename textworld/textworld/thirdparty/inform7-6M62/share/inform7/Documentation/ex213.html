<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.2. New commands for old grammar</p>
<p>In the photography example, we are providing entirely new grammar for an action  not ordinarily built in to Inform. But we often want simply to provide alternative grammar for existing actions, or even to put new interpretations on commands that Inform already recognises. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1320" -->
<a id="c1320"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;deposit [something] in [an open container]&quot; as inserting it into.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The inserting action is built in to Inform, but the command &quot;deposit&quot; is not, so this is created as new. It is occasionally useful to put a twist on this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1321" -->
<a id="c1321"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;fill [an open container] with [something]&quot; as inserting it into (with nouns reversed).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The clause &quot;(with nouns reversed)&quot; tells Inform to exchange the two nouns parsed, which is necessary because the inserting action expects the noun to be the item and the second noun to be the container, not vice versa.</p>
<p>The following example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1322" -->
<a id="c1322"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;access [something]&quot; as opening.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>might look as if it makes &quot;access&quot; behave just like &quot;open&quot; when the player types it, but that's not so: &quot;open&quot; can also be used in constructions like &quot;open the door with the brass key&quot;, in which case it is understood as the unlocking action. We could add another line to make &quot;access&quot; behave this way too, but if what we really want is to make &quot;access&quot; behave just like &quot;open&quot;, it's easier simply to say so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1323" -->
<a id="c1323"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the command &quot;access&quot; as &quot;open&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is very useful when adding a new command which needs synonyms:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1324" -->
<a id="c1324"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;snap&quot; and &quot;picture&quot; as &quot;photograph&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can check the current stock of commands by looking at the table in the Actions index: for instance, before making &quot;snap&quot; synonymous with &quot;photograph&quot;, it might be wise to check that it is not already defined as a command for breaking something.</p>

<p>&quot;Cloak of Darkness&quot; is a brief example game that has been implemented in nearly every IF system currently used. It hasn't got much claim to complexity or richness, but it does exemplify many of the standard things one might want an IF language to be able to do: define descriptions and the results of actions, assign synonyms to nouns, create new verbs, handle darkness, track repeated acts, and so on.</p>

<p>Whatever room we define first becomes the starting room of the game, in the absence of other instructions:</p>

<p>We can add more rooms by specifying their relation to the first room. Unless we say otherwise, the connection will automatically be bidirectional, so &quot;The Cloakroom is west of the Foyer&quot; will also mean &quot;The Foyer is east of the Cloakroom&quot;:</p>

<p>We could if we wished use a number to indicate how many times the player has stepped on the message, but Inform also makes it easy to add descriptive properties of this sort, so that the code remains readable even when the reader does not know what &quot;the number of the message&quot; might mean.</p>
