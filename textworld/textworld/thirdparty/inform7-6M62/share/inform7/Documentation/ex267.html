<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.10. Commands consisting only of nouns</p>
<p>In every example so far, and in almost all practical cases, the first word in a command which results in an action will be something fixed: a verb, in fact. When we write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1357" -->
<a id="c1357"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;photograph [something]&quot; as photographing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>we are saying that the first word of such a command will always be &quot;photograph&quot;. Occasionally, though, we would like to understand a noun as a command, perhaps in a situation where the command is obvious. If we say:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1358" -->
<a id="c1358"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;[something]&quot; as examining.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the command &quot;examine&quot; will be implicit when the player types a bare noun:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1359" -->
<a id="c1359"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A red box and a blue ball are here.
<br />&gt; BALL
<br />The blue ball is plaited from many small leather patches.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>so that the command &quot;ball&quot; has resulted in the action &quot;examining the blue ball&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a feature which should be used sparingly, since it could easily lead to confusion if not carefully explained to the player. By default, it is not used at all.</p>
<p>It also has what may be a serious limitation: verbless commands like this work only when typed by the player as actions to follow - they do not work as instructions for other people. So for instance SVEN, BALL would not ask Sven to try examining the ball - instead it would generate the action &quot;answering ball to Sven&quot;. (This is because the Inform parser decides whether PERSON, SOME TEXT is a request or just conversation by looking at the first word after the comma to see if it's a command.)</p>

<p>Notice that we continue the movement until one of two things happens: either the player reaches the room that is his destination, or the going attempt doesn't work. In the latter case we stop the action in order to avoid hanging the game up in a loop. This event might occur when the player runs into a locked door, for instance.</p>
