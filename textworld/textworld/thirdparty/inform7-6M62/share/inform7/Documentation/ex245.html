<p>Adding to the previous example story, we apply rules which depend on travelling by a particular vehicle:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c521" -->
<a id="c521"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The book trolley is in the Musicology Section. &quot;The book trolley, a sort of motorised tractor for trundling around through the stacks, is parked here.&quot; The trolley is a vehicle. Instead of going nowhere by the trolley, say &quot;Don't go crashing the trolley into walls.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c522" -->
<a id="c522"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of going to the Front Stacks by the trolley, say &quot;The Front Stacks are far too confined for the trolley to manoeuvre into them.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And, lastly, rules which apply to movements through particular doors:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c523" -->
<a id="c523"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The green baize door is east of the Catalogue Room and west of the Clerk's Office. The green baize door is an open door.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c524" -->
<a id="c524"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Before going through the green baize door, say &quot;Through you go...&quot; After going through the green baize door: try looking; say &quot;...and here you are.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Note that these apply whether the action is &quot;going east&quot; or &quot;entering the green baize door&quot;, each having the same effect.) The last rule is worth a second look: the normal way that a &quot;going&quot; action is reported is to produce the room description of the new location. So if an &quot;after&quot; rule stops the action before we get to reporting, we have to produce any room description by hand (hence the &quot;try looking&quot; to cause the looking action). Alternatively, we could simply say something and let the normal course of events take place:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c525" -->
<a id="c525"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After going through the green baize door: say &quot;...and here you are:&quot;; continue the action.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Finally, going is an action which can also happen while the player is pushing something from one room to another, and we can describe this like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c526" -->
<a id="c526"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of going from the Office with the trolley, say &quot;But it looks perfectly placed here. Why push any further?&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Going&quot; is not the only action which moves the player. Another is &quot;exiting&quot;, an action which moves the player out of whatever he/she is currently in or on. This action is often caused by the player typing just OUT or GET DOWN, and there's no noun as such. But Inform allows the syntax &quot;exiting from&quot; to make it easier to write rules about the exiting of particular containers or supporters:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c527" -->
<a id="c527"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After exiting from the Mini Cooper:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You painstakingly unpack your limbs from the tiny car.&quot;
</p></blockquote>

<p>There are two aspects of Inform's handling of pushable objects that are particularly prime for modification. One is that we may want to change the language used to refuse the pushing of unpushable objects.</p>
<p>Second, Inform by default assumes that it is impossible to push objects in up or down directions. This makes lots of sense if the player is trying to push a wheelbarrow up a ladder; it makes less sense if instead we're pushing a ball up a slope.</p>
<p>We solve both problems with some syntax borrowed from the chapter on rulebooks: in the first case, we replace the old rule with a new one with more friendly phrasing; in the second, we remove the rule entirely. More about how to do this is described in the rulebooks chapter; and in general we can find out what rules contribute to any given action by looking at the Actions index. In this case, the action is &quot;pushing it to&quot;, which has its own set of prerequisites (called check rules) that make sure the object can safely be pushed, before turning processing over to the going action.</p>

<p>There are two aspects of Inform's handling of pushable objects that are particularly prime for modification. One is that we may want to change the language used to refuse the pushing of unpushable objects.</p>
<p>Second, Inform by default assumes that it is impossible to push objects in up or down directions. This makes lots of sense if the player is trying to push a wheelbarrow up a ladder; it makes less sense if instead we're pushing a ball up a slope.</p>
<p>We solve both problems with some syntax borrowed from the chapter on rulebooks: in the first case, we replace the old rule with a new one with more friendly phrasing; in the second, we remove the rule entirely. More about how to do this is described in the rulebooks chapter; and in general we can find out what rules contribute to any given action by looking at the Actions index. In this case, the action is &quot;pushing it to&quot;, which has its own set of prerequisites (called check rules) that make sure the object can safely be pushed, before turning processing over to the going action.</p>
