<p class="sectionheading">ยง14.6. Adapting demonstratives and possessives</p>
<p>Consider the following message: how might we make this adaptive?</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1056" -->
<a id="c1056"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt; MEASURE TOP SHELF
<br />You really are not tall enough to reach that.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The verbal part is easy enough, but &quot;that&quot; needs a new feature.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1057" -->
<a id="c1057"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[We] really [are not] tall enough to reach [regarding the noun][those].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This could then adapt to, say,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1058" -->
<a id="c1058"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt; MEASURE JAM TARTS
<br />He really was not tall enough to reach those.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Notice that it's &quot;[regarding the noun][those]&quot;, not just &quot;[those]&quot;. If we wrote &quot;[those]&quot;, Inform would make it agree with the player, who was printed earlier in the sentence by the &quot;[We]&quot;.</p>
<p>Lastly, how about:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1059" -->
<a id="c1059"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt; PUT TEAPOT IN MOUSEHOLE
<br />The teapot's height is just too great.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This time we want:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1060" -->
<a id="c1060"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[regarding the noun][Possessive] height is just too great.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which might adapt to, say,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1061" -->
<a id="c1061"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Our height is just too great.
<br />Alice's height will be just too great.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Actually, &quot;[regarding ...]&quot; can be used for a description of possibly many items, too. For example:</p>
<p>Every turn when the player carries something:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1062" -->
<a id="c1062"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
say &quot;Every possession is a worry. I wonder if [regarding things carried by the player][they] still [look] okay in your pocket?&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So if the player carries just a single coin, say, this automatically becomes:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1063" -->
<a id="c1063"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every possession is a worry. I wonder if it still looks okay in your pocket?
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>but if the player carries a pair of scissors (a single plural-named item) or a coin and an iPhone, it becomes:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1064" -->
<a id="c1064"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Every possession is a worry. I wonder if they still look okay in your pocket?
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Once again these text substitutions are available in capitalised and uncapitalised forms:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1065" -->
<a id="c1065"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[Those]&quot; or &quot;[those]&quot;
<br />&quot;[Possessive]&quot; or &quot;[possessive]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In fact &quot;[Those]&quot; and &quot;[those]&quot; do subtly different things, besides the capital letter, because &quot;[Those]&quot; expects to be the subject of the sentence and &quot;[those]&quot; the object, and this makes a difference if the noun in question is a person. If the noun is an odious person called Tilly then</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1066" -->
<a id="c1066"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[regarding the noun][Those] is unacceptable.&quot;
<br />&quot;You've never liked [regarding the noun][those].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>would come out as &quot;She is unacceptable&quot; - so &quot;[Those]&quot; becomes &quot;She&quot; - but &quot;You've never liked her&quot; - so &quot;[those]&quot; becomes &quot;her&quot;. If we need these in different cases, we can explicitly ask for that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1067" -->
<a id="c1067"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[those in the nominative]&quot;
<br />&quot;[Those in the accusative]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
