<p>Just as Inform normally assumes everything is solid, it also assumes that these solid objects will not buckle, crack, break or deform under pressure, and cannot be fragmented. But breakability adds realism, and breakage need not be negative: sometimes we want the player to break her way in to something.</p>
<p>In IF the word DROP is more often used to mean &quot;put down&quot; or &quot;leave behind&quot; than &quot;let go from a height&quot;: so it is perhaps unfair that in <span class="boldface">Ming Vase</span> something fragile, when dropped, shatters (into nothing). In <span class="boldface">Spring Cleaning</span>, fragile objects must be explicitly attacked by the player in order to break, and although they leave no tangible debris behind, their loss is at least remembered. <span class="boldface">Kyoto</span> provides a general-purpose model for things being thrown at other things, with consequences including things moving (even between rooms) as well as breaking each other.</p>
<p>Debris from breakages is to be avoided if possible because it means keeping track of increasing numbers of objects. But we can increase realism by allowing something to have a visibly &quot;broken&quot; state, which it changes to when it breaks, rather than simply vanishing. <span class="boldface">Terracottissima</span> provides for broken and unbroken flowerpots in this way.</p>
<p>Since &quot;part of&quot; allows us to have two objects joined together into what the player sees as one, it also gives us a natural seam which allows the whole to be broken back down into its component parts, and this is the neatest way of providing a breakage into pieces. <span class="boldface">Paddington</span> demonstrates a cutting action which allows component parts to be cut away from their holders but will only make small surface gashes in any individual thing: so the player can cut something up, but only into the pieces we specifically choose to allow. Cutting also forces an opening into containers.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But suppose that we'd like cutting also to make containers be permanently open and impossible to close again. We could write an &quot;instead&quot; rule, but that would mean that only our instead instructions would take effect, overriding the normal cutting it with rules entirely.

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the noun is unopenable.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now our rule will occur whenever a container is cut, but play will still go on to the reporting stage. And indeed we can add more of these, of varying degrees of specificity:</p>

<p>For that matter, we might want to add a report rule as well, to occur after the &quot;You slash...&quot; rule, so that every time the player cuts something open which has contents, the contents will be listed.</p>
