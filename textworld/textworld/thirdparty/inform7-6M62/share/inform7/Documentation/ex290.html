<p class="sectionheading">ยง12.11. Making actions work for other people</p>
<p>The &quot;photographing&quot; action now works very nicely when the player does it. But not when others try. Suppose that neither the player, nor Clark Gable, is holding the camera:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c885" -->
<a id="c885"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;photograph clark
<br />You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c886" -->
<a id="c886"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt;clark, photograph me
<br />&gt;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>An uncanny silence. What has happened is that the rules written so far are all implicitly restricted to the player only. This is because when we write -</p>
<!-- START CODE "c887" -->
<a id="c887"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Check photographing:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the camera is not carried:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;You can hardly photograph without a camera, now can you?&quot; instead.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>the action is &quot;photographing&quot;, not &quot;Clark photographing&quot;. In the next few sections we shall see how to make the rules work nicely for everybody. This is a little bit harder, so it should be noted right away that in many projects there is no need. In a story which has no other characters who succumb to persuasion, for instance, only the player will ever try the action.</p>
