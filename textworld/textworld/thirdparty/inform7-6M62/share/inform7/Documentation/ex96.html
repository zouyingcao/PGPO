<p>It is quite allowed for a scene to be linked to several other scenes, and this is useful if several alternate strands of plot are being brought together in a common resolution scene:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c721" -->
<a id="c721"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Rejection ends.
<br />Bittersweet Ending begins when Stranger's Acceptance ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and we can also have the same scene beginning when a condition holds. In general, it will begin the first time it gets any chance to do so.</p>
<p>All scenes are ordinarily set up so that they can happen only once. But sometimes we want them to repeat. Suppose the train calls not once only, but every twenty minutes. We could set this up with two scenes linked back to back like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c722" -->
<a id="c722"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Train Stop is a recurring scene. Train Wait is a recurring scene.
<br />Train Wait begins when play begins.
<br />Train Stop begins when Train Wait ends.
<br />Train Wait begins when Train Stop ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The difference here is that these scenes have been declared as &quot;recurring&quot;. In all other respects they are the same as any other scene.</p>
