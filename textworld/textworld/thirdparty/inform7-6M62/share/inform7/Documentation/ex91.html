<p>Creating a new rulebook is also straightforward, as we see in the following modest example story:</p>

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1610" -->
<a id="c1610"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
An appraisal rule: say &quot;Click... whirr... the score is [the score in words] points.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1611" -->
<a id="c1611"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if we have taken the idol, say &quot;Most importantly of all, the idol has been found.&quot;

<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1612" -->
<a id="c1612"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The creation of the rulebook is all very well, but without the final sentence it would never be used. The crucial new phrase here is:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn273" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn273"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>follow </b>(rule)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_follow -->

<p>This phrase causes the rule to be obeyed immediately (rather than simply at predetermined times such as when a particular action is being tried, or at the end of every turn, and such). Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1613" -->
<a id="c1613"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
follow the advance time rule;
<br />follow the appraisal rulebook;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>Like &quot;number&quot; or &quot;text&quot;, &quot;rule&quot; and &quot;rulebook&quot; are kinds of value built into Inform: &quot;the blossom rule&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rule&quot;, whereas &quot;the every turn rules&quot; is a value whose kind is &quot;rulebook&quot;. In fact, Inform considers a rulebook to be a special case of a rule, so that whenever a rule is required it is legal to name a rulebook instead, but not vice versa. The &quot;follow&quot; phrase here...</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1614" -->
<a id="c1614"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of switching on the machine, follow the appraisal rules.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...expects to be applied to a value of kind &quot;rule&quot;; &quot;the appraisal rules&quot; is in fact a rulebook, but since that counts as a rule the phrase makes sense to Inform. To follow a rulebook means to run through all its rules in turn, stopping when one rule reaches an outcome; to follow a single rule means just that one, of course.</p>
<p>When created, a rulebook starts out with no rules in it - in this example, of course, we quickly defined a couple of rules to go into it. But it's often the case in Inform that a rulebook exists without ever being stocked up, especially if the rulebook is for some obscure purpose never needed. The built-in adjectives &quot;empty&quot; and &quot;non-empty&quot;, applied to a rulebook, test whether any rule is present or not.</p>

<p>Observation of novice IF players suggests that they often have a hard time figuring out how to get started, especially if they are encountering the game in a context where they don't have time to settle in and read instructions. Here we provide some training wheels to help them learn to communicate.</p>
<p>This is divided into several parts. The first part is the system of rules for general guidance, which could be excerpted and used anywhere. The second part is a scenario using these rules.</p>
