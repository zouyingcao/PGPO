<p class="sectionheading">ยง5.13. Making new substitutions</p>
<p>If we have some textual effect which needs to occur in several different messages, we might want to create a new text substitution for it. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c376" -->
<a id="c376"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Missile Base is a room. &quot;[security notice]Seems to be a futuristic missile base.&quot; M's Office is east of the Missile Base. &quot;[security notice]Admiral Sir M.- M.- glares up from his desk.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c377" -->
<a id="c377"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To say security notice:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;This area is a Prohibited Place within the meaning of the Official Secrets Act 1939. &quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is only the tip of the iceberg in how to define ways to do things using &quot;To...&quot;, as we shall see. The definition makes &quot;say the security notice&quot; a new phrase known to Inform. A text substitution is exactly a phrase whose name begins with &quot;say&quot; (well - except for the &quot;say&quot; phrase itself), so the effect is that &quot;[security notice]&quot; is a new text substitution. Several of the examples in this chapter make use of this trick.</p>
<p>Inform often ignores the casing of the text it reads, but sometimes uses it as a clue to meaning. We have already seen that &quot;[an item]&quot; and &quot;[An item]&quot; produce different results, for instance. Similarly, it's possible to define two text substitutions which are the same except for the initial casing. We might write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c378" -->
<a id="c378"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
To say Security Notice:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;THIS AREA IS A PROHIBITED PLACE WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE OFFICIAL SECRETS ACT 1939. &quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>And now Inform will act on &quot;[Security Notice]&quot; differently from &quot;[security notice]&quot;.</p>

<p>So the effects we can get with text substitutions are quite flexible. We could even, if we wanted, fill in the substitutions by random choice, or by selecting items from a long list or table, should we have so bellicose a set of characters that they cannot make do with one or two insulting remarks apiece.</p>

<p>So the effects we can get with text substitutions are quite flexible. We could even, if we wanted, fill in the substitutions by random choice, or by selecting items from a long list or table, should we have so bellicose a set of characters that they cannot make do with one or two insulting remarks apiece.</p>

<p>There is only so much we can cram into a text property, so being able to swap in properties is useful but limited. Fortunately, we can also, if we want, create new phrases for how to say things in brackets:</p>
