<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.15. Understanding things by their properties</p>
<p>Items are ordinarily understood only by their original given names. For instance, if we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1378" -->
<a id="c1378"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Herb Garden is a china pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the player could refer to this as &quot;pot&quot;, &quot;china pot&quot; or &quot;china&quot;. We can embellish this by adding extra forms:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1379" -->
<a id="c1379"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;chinese pot&quot; or &quot;chinese vase&quot; as the china pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But suppose the pot changes its nature in the course of play? If we have:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1380" -->
<a id="c1380"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The china pot can be unbroken or broken. The china pot is unbroken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1381" -->
<a id="c1381"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After dropping the china pot:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the china pot is broken;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed name of the pot is &quot;broken pot&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So now the player would reasonably expect to call it &quot;broken pot&quot;, a wording which would have been rejected before. We can achieve this by writing:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1382" -->
<a id="c1382"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the unbroken property as describing the pot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which allows &quot;unbroken&quot; or &quot;broken&quot; to describe the pot, depending on its state. And, since the player might well use a different adjective but with the same idea in mind, we can even add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1383" -->
<a id="c1383"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;shattered&quot; or &quot;cracked&quot; or &quot;smashed&quot; as broken. Understand &quot;pristine&quot; as unbroken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is something of a toy example, but the feature looks rather more useful when there are more pots than just one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1384" -->
<a id="c1384"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('[=0x0022=]Terracotta[=0x0022=][=0x000A=][=0x000A=]A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken.

</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1385" -->
<a id="c1385"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A flowerpot is a kind of thing. A flowerpot can be unbroken or broken. Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1386" -->
<a id="c1386"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After dropping an unbroken flowerpot:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;say &quot;Crack!&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the noun is broken;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpot&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;now the printed plural name of the noun is &quot;broken flowerpots&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1387" -->
<a id="c1387"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Herb Garden is a room. In the Herb Garden are ten unbroken flowerpots.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We then have the dialogue:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1388" -->
<a id="c1388"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Herb Garden
<br />You can see ten flowerpots here.
<br />&gt;get two flowerpots
<br />flowerpot: Taken.
<br />flowerpot: Taken.
<br />&gt;drop all
<br />flowerpot: Crack!
<br />flowerpot: Crack!
<br />&gt;look
<br />Herb Garden
<br />You can see two broken flowerpots and eight flowerpots here.
<br />&gt;get an unbroken flowerpot
<br />Taken.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>There are in fact two slightly different forms of this kind of sentence:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1389" -->
<a id="c1389"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the broken property as describing a flowerpot.
<br />Understand the broken property as referring to a flowerpot.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The only difference is that in the &quot;describing&quot; case, the property's name alone can mean the thing in question - so &quot;take unbroken&quot; will work; whereas, in the &quot;referring to&quot;, the property's name can only be used as an adjective preceding the name of thing itself - so &quot;take unbroken flowerpot&quot; will work but &quot;take unbroken&quot; will not.</p>
