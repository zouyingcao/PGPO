<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.3. Clothing</p>
<p>A person can wear any (portable) thing which has the &quot;wearable&quot; property. (This property seldom needs to be quoted because it is deduced automatically from sentences like &quot;Trevor wears a red hat.&quot;)</p>
<p>In most traditional IF, clothing is only used when it is exceptional in some way. That is, we ignore the three to eight different garments most people are wearing at any given time - the everyday clothes which people wear without thinking about them - and only simulate the unexpected extras: a borrowed jaunty red hat, a radiation-proof space suit, and so on.</p>
<p>These unusual garments turn up only occasionally in play and usually one at a time, so Inform does not normally provide rules to restrict how much or little is worn, or in what unlikely combinations. <span class="boldface">Get Me to the Church on Time</span> categorises clothing by body area (trousers for lower body, shirts for upper); <span class="boldface">Bogart</span> by layer, distinguishing underwear from outer garments. <span class="boldface">What Not To Wear</span> combines both into a general-purpose system adequate for most kinds of clothing situations.</p>
<p class="crossreference"><a href="RB_8_5.html" class="xreflink"><img class="asterisk" alt="*" src="Documentation/Images/xref.png" />&#160;<i>See </i><b>Kitchen and Bathroom</b></a><i> for a simple mirror implementation, which could be adapted to reflect what the player is currently wearing</i></p><p><span class="boldface">Hays Code</span> is a somewhat stripped down version.</p>
<p>Clothes are normally single things which have no function other than display and concealment, but <span class="boldface">Being Prepared</span> gives them pockets which act as containers, and <span class="boldface">Some Assembly Required</span> allows clothes to be stitched together from pieces of cloth.</p>
