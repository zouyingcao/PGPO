<p>We are allowed to link the beginning or end of any scene to the beginning or end of any other scene. So, for instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c718" -->
<a id="c718"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble is a scene. Luggage Trouble begins when Brief Encounter begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Thus the two scenes run concurrently, at least for a while. We can also add that:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c719" -->
<a id="c719"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Luggage Trouble ends when Brief Encounter ends.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This can be useful when a large, complicated scene really contains several smaller sub-scenes.</p>
<p>A special exceptional case is that we can have any scene or scenes starting right at the outset:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c720" -->
<a id="c720"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Railway Meeting is a scene. Railway Meeting begins when play begins.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>When play ends, of course, all scenes end, so there is no need to say that.</p>

The player carries a lockpick, a smoke bomb, a grappling hook, and a pair of gloves. The description of the lockpick is &quot;Effective on most kinds of key locks, it is a gift from your mentor in the discipline, old Wheezy.&quot; The description of the smoke bomb is &quot;Your last of these, so you should rely on it only when other modes of escape have vanished. It takes effect when dropped, producing a cloud of purple haze sufficient to fill a medium-sized room.&quot; The description of the grappling hook is &quot;Good for shooting at balconies and other sorts of overhang.&quot;  The gloves are wearable. The description of the gloves is &quot;Black and shiny, with gripping material on the palms. Batman would be jealous.&quot;
