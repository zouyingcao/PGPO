<p>The following description runs to only 33 words, but makes a surprisingly intricate design. It not only places things within rooms, but also places them very specifically with respect to each other:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c101" -->
<a id="c101"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;Midsummer Day&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c102" -->
<a id="c102"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
East of the Garden is the Gazebo. Above is the Treehouse. A billiards table is in the Gazebo. On it is a trophy cup. A starting pistol is in the cup.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform needs to identify the places and objects being described by the nouns here, and to guess what it can about them. For instance, the pistol can be picked up but not walked inside, whereas the Treehouse is the reverse. (This is obvious to someone who knows what these words mean, less obvious to a computer which does not, but the text contains sufficient clues.) Inform does this by sorting the various nouns into different categories, which are called &quot;kinds&quot;. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c103" -->
<a id="c103"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Garden, Gazebo, Treehouse - <span class="boldface">room</span>
<br />billiards table - <span class="boldface">supporter</span>
<br />cup - <span class="boldface">container</span>
<br />starting pistol - <span class="boldface">thing</span>
<br />East, up (implied by &quot;above&quot;) - <span class="boldface">direction</span>
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(A container is something which can contain other things, and a supporter similarly.) For instance Inform knows that if one thing is in another, then the second thing is either a room or a container, and if one thing is on another, the second thing is a supporter. This worked nicely for the design above, but:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c104" -->
<a id="c104"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Treehouse is a cardboard box.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>results in the cardboard box being made only a &quot;thing&quot;: because nothing has been put inside it, there is no reason for Inform - which does not know what a cardboard box looks like - to guess that it is a &quot;container&quot;. So we need to add:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c105" -->
<a id="c105"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The box is a container.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It is rather clumsy to have to write two sentences like this, so we would normally write this instead:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c106" -->
<a id="c106"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
In the Treehouse is a container called the cardboard box.
</p></blockquote>

<p>By default, Inform does not understand the names of an object's kind as referring to that object, unless the object has no other name of its own. We can change this, if we like, by defining names that should be applied to everything of a given kind:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c13165" -->
<a id="c13165"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Lewis and Harper are men in the Crew Lounge. Understand &quot;man&quot; or &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;chap&quot; or &quot;lad&quot; or &quot;male&quot; as a man. Understand &quot;men&quot; or &quot;chaps&quot; or &quot;lads&quot; or &quot;guys&quot; or &quot;males&quot; as the plural of a man.
</p></blockquote>

The description of Lewis is &quot;A wiry, excitable engineer who just signed aboard last week.&quot; The description of Harper is &quot;Harper's a good guy: taciturn when sober, affectionate when drunk, but rarely annoying in either state.&quot;

<p>Inform's naming abilities go considerably further, in fact: we can also instruct it to understand words only under certain circumstances, or only when they appear with other words. Fuller details may be found in the chapter on Understanding.</p>
