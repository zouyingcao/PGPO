<p>Recording what is going on, for later playing back or examination, is difficult because the range of situations is very complex. Exactly how much information should we store when we make a recording, and will this require problematically large tables? Will it be difficult even to do at all?</p>
<p>The usual approach is to record only basic details of events or situations. In <span class="boldface">If It Hadn't Been For...</span> the tape recorder preserves only a few different sounds - footsteps, creaking, rustling - rather than capturing exactly the sound of every action taking place in earshot. In <span class="boldface">Claims Adjustment</span>, we can take up to 36 Polaroid-style photographs, but each is described only by saying what it is a photo of. Thus we can have a photograph of a vase, or even a photograph of a photograph of a vase (because that too is a thing), but not a photograph of a still life in which several items have been gathered together by the player. That would ordinarily require too much storage.</p>
<p>A similar trick, though involving impromptu sculpture rather than photography, can be found in <span class="boldface">Originals</span>. (The artist magically &quot;manifests&quot; these models rather than sculpting the conventional way in order to avoid the nuisance of carrying around raw materials - wax maquettes and so forth - which would clutter up the example.)</p>
<p>Text, of course, can store arbitrary descriptions. <span class="boldface">Mirror, Mirror</span> provides a perfect visual recorder: it remembers a room description exactly as the player saw it at the time.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Actor's Studio</span> provides a video camera that records and time stamps all actions performed in its presence while it is set to record.</p>

<p>Now, the challenge is that we want to print the word &quot;actual&quot; before printing the name of an object, but only during disambiguation questions and only when we are not printing the name of the object as part of a model-name! (If we are not careful about the latter point, we will get responses such as &quot;Which do you mean, the model actual deer or the actual deer?&quot; which of course defeats the whole purpose.</p>
<p>The way around this is to remember that activities stack: we're printing the name of the deer while printing the name of a model that involves the deer. So if we set a flag while printing the name of a model, we can control the way the deer's name prints during the transaction. (We could use our ...while clause to specify while not printing the name of a model, except that we're already using it for &quot;while asking which do you mean&quot;, and these do not stack.) So:</p>
