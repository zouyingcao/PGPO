<p>By default, Inform characters are a bit grudging about giving and sharing objects: they react with disinterest when they're shown things and refuse everything they're offered.</p>
<p>If we'd like to change this, we can simply remove the default &quot;block giving&quot; rule, as in</p>

<p>If we do this, giving items to characters will have the result of moving our possessions to the other person's inventory. Of course, without more customization, the player may not ever be able to persuade the other character to return his possessions. <span class="boldface">Bribery</span> demonstrates a scenario in which a character will accept gifts if they are interesting to him, and respond with a changed attitude to the player.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Barter Barter</span> expands further on this by allowing other characters to trade things with one another.</p>
