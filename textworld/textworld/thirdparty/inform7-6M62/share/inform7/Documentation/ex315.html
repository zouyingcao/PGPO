<p class="sectionheading">ยง23.14. Writing, reading and appending text to files</p>
<p>Text can also be saved to a file, and again all file-handling is automatic:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn372" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn372"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>write </b>(text)<b> to </b>(external file)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_writetext -->

<p>This phrase makes the given text become the entire contents of the named file. Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1923" -->
<a id="c1923"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
write &quot;Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.&quot; to the file of Abecedary Wisdom;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<!-- START PHRASE "defn373" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn373"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>append </b>(text)<b> to </b>(external file)<b></b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_appendtext -->

<p>This phrase adds the given text to the end of the current contents of the named file (creating it if it does not exist on disc). Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1924" -->
<a id="c1924"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
append &quot;Jinxed wizards pluck ivy from the big quilt.&quot; to the file of Abecedary Wisdom;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The quoted text can, of course, contain substitutions, so can be long and complex if need be.</p>
<p>Text from a file is printed back with the text substitution:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn374" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn374"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>say &quot;[text of </b>(external file)<b>]&quot;</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_saytext -->

<p>This text expands to the contents of the named file. Note that files must have been declared, and must be referred to by their Inform names, not by textual filenames. Example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1925" -->
<a id="c1925"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&quot;[text of the File of Abecedary Wisdom]&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>To copy one file to another, for instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1926" -->
<a id="c1926"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
write &quot;[text of the file of Abecedary Wisdom]&quot; to the file of Secondary Wisdom;
</p></blockquote>
