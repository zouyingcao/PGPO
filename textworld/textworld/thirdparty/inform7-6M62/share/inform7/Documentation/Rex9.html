<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.2. Ships, Trains and Elevators</p>
<p>This section covers vehicles whose interior consists of at least one entire room. Moving into this room constitutes boarding: there is then some pause while it travels: moving out again disembarks at a different location. The only complication arising is how the player controls the journey (by talking to someone? by pressing buttons? by steering?).</p>
<p><span class="boldface">The Unbuttoned Elevator Affair</span> provides the simplest possible whole-room vehicle, which ferries between two fixed points. If you are at one of these, it must be the other one you want to get to, so there is no need for controls.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Dubai</span> is a much more elaborate elevator, with many possible destinations, chosen using buttons inside the elevator.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Empire</span> simulates a train journey. Here there are no controls as such, but the train passes through a sequence of stops spaced apart in time, so the player chooses an exit by getting out at the right moment.</p>
<p>On a very large, slowish craft such as a cruise liner, we are not so much travelling in a vehicle: it's more as if we are visiting a whole building, which becomes our world for the (probably long) duration of the journey. The liner steers around in long, slow curves, changing its orientation in the water, so that (if we think of &quot;north&quot; as a strictly magnetic matter, anyway) north is constantly rotating: something we don't notice on board because our own reference points, provided by the ship itself, stay fixed relative to ourselves. Because of this, some ships in IF are navigated using FORE, AFT, PORT and STARBOARD directions rather than NORTH, EAST, SOUTH and WEST: see <span class="boldface">Fore</span>.</p>

<p>And we can even add new ways to talk about the ways things are mapped, borrowing from the Relations chapter. The following will allow us to use &quot;is abaft of&quot; as well as &quot;is aft of&quot;:</p>

[The verb to be abaft of means the mapping aft relation.]

<!-- START CODE "c24196" -->
<a id="c24196"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A room can be nautical or earthbound. A room is usually not nautical. A direction can be nautical or earthbound. A direction is usually not nautical. Starboard, port, fore, aft, up, down, the inside and the outside are nautical.

The description of the Fish Room is &quot;Absurd quantities of salt fish are kept here, and periodically visited by the cook or someone serving him.

The description of the Spirit Room is &quot;Despite its ghostly name, this is little more than a closet down at the very navel of the ship, in which alcohol is kept: both for purifying wounds and for drinking. Under normal circumstances there is a guard posted here at every hour, lest anyone take to raiding the larder. The current absence of the guard marine strikes you as a very bad sign indeed.

[paragraph break]What is kept here would not, on land, be dignified by the name of bread: it's hard tack, punishing to the teeth, dry on the tongue, and usually a home to weevils before half the journey is done.
