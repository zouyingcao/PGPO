<p>&quot;Disenchantment Bay&quot; is a simple work of IF used as a running example in Chapter 3 of <span class="italic">Writing with Inform</span> - not so much a tutorial as a convenient hook on which to hang some demonstrations of the basics. Because the resulting examples only use basic features and in the most straightforward way, they make for uninteresting &quot;recipes&quot; - so they are not included in the <span class="italic">Recipe Book</span> proper. But some readers might like to have all twelve stages of the example gathered on a single page: this is that page.</p>
