<p class="sectionheading">§15.8. Units</p>
<p>Suppose we want to talk about how tall people are. We could just create a &quot;number&quot; property, like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1153" -->
<a id="c1153"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A person has a number called height.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>But then we would have to write lines like &quot;Isabella has height 68&quot;, which nobody would naturally say. What we want is to be able to write &quot;Isabella is 5 foot 8.&quot; Perhaps the computer will need to store that measurement as the number 68 in some register or other, but we don't want to know about that.</p>
<p>&quot;5 foot 8&quot; is a complicated notation in a way - it involves both feet and inches - so let's start with a simpler example:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1154" -->
<a id="c1154"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A weight is a kind of value. 10kg specifies a weight.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is a little different to the kinds of value seen so far, which were all created like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1155" -->
<a id="c1155"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A colour is a kind of value. The colours are red, green and blue.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can't mix the two styles: a new kind of value will either be numerical at heart (&quot;10kg&quot;) or verbal at heart (&quot;blue&quot;).</p>
<p>The effect of &quot;10kg specifies a weight&quot; is to tell Inform that this is the notation for writing a constant &quot;weight&quot;. So, for instance,</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1156" -->
<a id="c1156"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The maximum load is a weight that varies. The maximum load is 8000kg.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1157" -->
<a id="c1157"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the maximum load is greater than 8000kg, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Inform is then careful not to allow weights to be mixed up with other numerical values. For instance, it won't allow &quot;if the maximum load is 400&quot;, because 400 is a number, not a weight.</p>
<p>More or less anything we can do with numbers, we can now do with weights. For instance, we can write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1158" -->
<a id="c1158"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The Weighbridge is a room. &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is [maximum load].&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...which will produce the text &quot;A sign declares that the maximum load is 8000kg.&quot;</p>
<p>Numerical kinds of value are sometimes called &quot;units&quot;, because one of their main uses is to allow us to write quantities using scientific units such as kilograms. But they have other uses too. We have a great deal of freedom in creating notations like &quot;10kg&quot;, or &quot;4 foot 10&quot; - the main thing is that new notations must not already mean a value. So &quot;10 specifies a weight&quot; will not be allowed, because 10 specifies a number already.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">By default we can only write whole-number values.</span> As we've seen, Inform can handle both integer (whole-number) and real arithmetic, and they each have their advantages. The default here is to use whole numbers, so</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1159" -->
<a id="c1159"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
10 kg specifies a weight.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will store only whole numbers of kilograms (unless clever scaling tricks are used: see the next section). That may be fine, but if we need to handle a wider range of weights, or do scientific calculations that need to be more accurate, this is better:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1160" -->
<a id="c1160"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
1.0 kg specifies a weight.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Here Inform can see from the decimal point in the prototype number that real numbers will be involved. We can still write &quot;8000kg&quot;, but we can now also write &quot;1.9885 x 10^30 kg&quot; (the mass of the Sun) or &quot;9.109383 x 10^−31 kg&quot; (the mass of an electron). On the other hand, any calculations we do will be limited in accuracy to about 6 to 9 decimal places, exactly as for real numbers.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">By default we can only write positive values when whole numbers are used.</span> Sometimes it is unnatural to write negative values, and so Inform will issue a Problem message if this is tried - for instance, Inform would not allow us to write a weight of -4 kg. (This doesn't mean that arithmetic on units is forbidden to get a negative result: we may want to work out the difference between two weights. Inform's Problem message is simply to try to prevent the accidental writing of incorrect values.) If we do want the ability to write negative values in the source text, we signal that in the notation itself:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1161" -->
<a id="c1161"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
-10 kg specifies a weight.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That alerts Inform that both positive and negative values for this unit make sense.</p>
<p>If we set up a spread of multiple notations (see the next section) then this is automatically enabled, because then we're clearly dealing with proper physics, where negative values are common; and similarly if we use real numbers (as above).</p>

<p>This is a slight variation on the previous gas diffusion example: the main difference is that gas preferentially moves towards lower rooms, and will gradually settle in the bottom floor. We do this by calculating the probability of movement separately for each pair of rooms.</p>
