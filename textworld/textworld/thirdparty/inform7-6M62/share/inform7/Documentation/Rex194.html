<p class="sectionheading">ยง11.2. Saving and Undoing</p>
<p>A very few titles in the IF literature - very few being still too many, some would say - restrict the player's ability to save the story.</p>
<p>Removing the player's ability to UNDO is also a risky choice. Inform does provide the facility with the use option</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23737" -->
<a id="c23737"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use undo prevention.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>which makes it impossible to UNDO at any time (unless, that is, the player is playing on an interpreter that itself has a built-in UNDO feature -- these do exist). When it works, undo prevention safeguards a randomized story or combat session against brute-force solutions, but it also means that the player who makes even a minor mistake of typing will be stuck with the undesired results.</p>
<p>In many cases it may be preferable to use some subtler method to enforce random effects in a story. Several extensions exist for Inform that either allow selective manipulation of the UNDO command or rig randomization to prevent UNDO and replay attempts.</p>

Why only 349 out of 350? The answer varied, but sometimes the last point was earned by never saving the game - in other words by playing it right through with nothing to guard against mistakes (except perhaps UNDO for the last command), and in one long session.</p></td><td class="egcrossref"><!-- START IGNORE -->
