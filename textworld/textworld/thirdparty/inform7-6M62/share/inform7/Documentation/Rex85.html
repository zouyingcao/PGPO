<p class="sectionheading">ยง10.2. Liquids</p>
<p>Liquids are notoriously difficult to simulate well. A fully thorough approach consumes endless storage and can be very finicky to write and keep realistic. It is essential to decide what aspect of a liquid's behaviour is actually needed in a given story, and to simulate only that. For instance, if we only need a little chemistry, where a player can add (say) water to salt and make a solution, we do not want to fool around with calculating quantities or concentrations: what's important is that &quot;some water&quot; (amount unspecified) combines with &quot;some salt&quot; to produce &quot;some salty water&quot;. We should no more calculate precisely here than we would work out where all the furniture is to the nearest inch. Good advice for handling liquids is to simulate the least amount of realism possible, but no less.</p>
<p>Sometimes all we want is a down-in-one drink: we needn't simulate the actual liquid, just the bottle it comes in, and all we need is to handle the &quot;drinking&quot; action. See <span class="boldface">Beverage Service</span>, and also <span class="boldface">3 AM</span>, where carbonated drinks can be shaken - again simulating the vessel, not the liquid.</p>
<p>Some elementary biochemistry in <span class="boldface">Xylan</span> is done simply by... well, the point is that two different liquids are represented by single things each, and a chemical reaction simply switches one for the other.</p>
<p>In <span class="boldface">Frizz</span>, we allow any container to be filled with water (only) and we simulate what happens to any solid objects also inside: some waterproof, some not. <span class="boldface">Flotation</span> provides a well (always full of water), with rules to determine whether things dropped into it should sink or float.</p>
<p>Next we move up to quantitative approaches, where we remember not just whether a liquid is present, but how much of it. In its simplest form, we could have a drinking vessel from which we draw in sips, so that it can be full, half-empty or empty: see <span class="boldface">Thirst</span>.</p>
<p>The example with the best compromise between simulation quality and complexity is <span class="boldface">Lemonade</span>. Here we provide a kind of container called a &quot;fluid container&quot;, not just a single cup, and each such vessel has a given &quot;fluid capacity&quot;. Each holds only a single liquid at a time (so no mixtures) and can be empty or full to any level (rounded off to the nearest 0.1 fl oz). We can fill one vessel from another (unless it would make a mixture). But liquids leaving these vessels must be consumed - drunk or poured away without trace: we cannot make pools on the floor, or carry liquids in our cupped hands. There is no object representing &quot;lemonade&quot;: there are only fluid containers, but which can be called LEMONADE if that is what they now contain.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Savannah</span> is a light elaboration of Lemonade, showing how liquids might be poured on other objects, as for instance to extinguish a fire.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Noisy Cricket</span> extends <span class="boldface">Lemonade</span> to allow for mixing, though then the number of different possible mixtures is so large that complexity increases greatly. <span class="boldface">Lakeside Living</span> extends <span class="boldface">Lemonade</span> differently to add a &quot;liquid source&quot; kind, a form of fluid container which has infinite fluid capacity and is scenery - ideal for a lake, river or spring.</p>

<p>Liquids, and all substances that can be mixed or broken off in partial amounts, pose a challenge to model in interactive fiction. The following example is a simple one, but adequate for many scenarios.</p>
<p>We start by assuming that all liquids in the game will always appear in containers. The player can pour liquids from one container to another, and the containers keep track of how full they are and describe themselves appropriately. The player can also refer to containers by content.</p>
<p>Mixture, however, is not allowed, nor is it possible to put liquids on other objects, pour them out on the ground, etc. These ideas would require a more complicated set-up.</p>
