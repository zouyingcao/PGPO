<p class="sectionheading">ยง8.2. Changing the command prompt</p>
<p>The command prompt is the text printed by Inform to ask the player for another command. Ordinarily this is simply a greater-than-sign, &quot;&gt;&quot;, so we tend not to notice it as text at all. Internally, though, it is a variable value called &quot;command prompt&quot;, which means we can change it.</p>
<p>For example, this will be a more conversational sort of prompt:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c549" -->
<a id="c549"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins: now the command prompt is &quot;What now? &quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Whereas this will be more up-to-the-minute and demanding:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c550" -->
<a id="c550"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
When play begins: now the command prompt is &quot;[time of day] &gt;&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(&quot;Time of day&quot; is another variable value, which is fairly self-explanatory, but will be covered in detail later on.) The prompt can be changed at any point, so can be used to indicate the current situation, or even as a sly way to introduce a sort of conversation between computer and player.</p>

<p>Suppose our game features a detailed simulated combat between the player character and his opponent. He might have several weapons available, and several types of attack available; and at any given time he might be perched up in the rigging of his ship, standing on the open deck, or boxed in between some barrels. His options will vary depending on his position, and obviously it would detract from the pacing to make the player keep LOOKing in the middle of combat in order to remind himself where he is. Instead, we'll roll this information into the command prompt:</p>
