<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.7. Understanding any, understanding rooms</p>
<p>Ordinarily, if we write</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1339" -->
<a id="c1339"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;manipulate [something]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the &quot;[something]&quot; will only match what is within reach or sight: this is the concept of &quot;scope&quot;, which is what prevents a player from spookily acting on objects from a distance. The parser itself prevents the manipulation rules from ever being invoked on such distant items, which is as it should be.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, we positively want to allow this possibility. If we use the special word &quot;any&quot;, as in</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1340" -->
<a id="c1340"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;manipulate [any door]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then any door, anywhere in the model world, can be allowed in the player's command. (Of course, the manipulation rules may not do what the player hopes: all that has happened is that the command is now possible to type.) The &quot;any&quot; can be followed by any description of items or rooms, and the latter opens up new possibilities, since rooms are ordinarily never allowed to be named in the player's commands.</p>
<p>For example, the following gives the player the ability to walk between rooms without giving explicit directions of movement.</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1341" -->
<a id="c1341"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Going by name is an action applying to one thing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1342" -->
<a id="c1342"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Carry out going by name: say &quot;You walk to [the noun].&quot;; move the player to the noun.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c1343" -->
<a id="c1343"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;go to [any adjacent visited room]&quot; as going by name.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(This is really only a sketch: in a finished work, &quot;go to&quot; would produce helpful errors if non-adjacent but visited rooms were named, and we might also worry about rules applying to movement, because the method above will circumvent them.)</p>
<p>As might be expected, &quot;[anything]&quot; means the same as &quot;[any thing]&quot;; &quot;[anybody]&quot; and &quot;[anyone]&quot; mean the same as &quot;[any person]&quot;; and &quot;[anywhere]&quot; means the same as &quot;[any room]&quot;.</p>
