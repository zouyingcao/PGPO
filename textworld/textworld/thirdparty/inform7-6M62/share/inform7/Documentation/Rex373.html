<p class="sectionheading">ยง7.11. Character Knowledge and Reasoning</p>
<p>A character may be endowed with knowledge and even reasoning skills. Relations form quite a good way of keeping track of such problems: for instance, we can allow characters to be acquainted with one another with a relation such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23702" -->
<a id="c23702"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Lucy knows Lady Cardew.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or we might keep track of more complicated attitudes between characters, as in <span class="boldface">Murder on the Orient Express</span>, in which some characters suspect others of the crime.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we might have a list of salient facts that are important in our story. We might declare these as values, and then characters could know, learn, and forget entries as appropriate:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23703" -->
<a id="c23703"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A fact is a kind of value. Some facts are defined by the Table of All Known Facts.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23704" -->
<a id="c23704"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Knowledge relates various people to various facts. The verb to know (he knows, they know, he knew, it is known) implies the knowledge relation.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23705" -->
<a id="c23705"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Table of All Known Facts
<br />fact   	summary
<br />shoe-size   	&quot;Lucy wears a size 9 shoe.&quot;
<br />sunset-time   	&quot;Sunset is at 8:22 PM this evening.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<!-- START CODE "c23706" -->
<a id="c23706"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Lucy knows shoe-size.
<br />Bob knows sunset-time and shoe-size.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or again we might keep a whole database of information in a table: the characters in <span class="boldface">Questionable Revolutions</span> know dates, countries, and a short description for each of several rebellions and popular uprisings, while in <span class="boldface">Queen of Sheba</span>, Solomon is able to answer who, what, where, when, and why questions about a range of topics. This kind of approach is most useful when the characters need to display a deep knowledge of a particular field. The facts stored in the Table of All Known Facts, above, are comparatively sparse, because there we are designing a story in which not all data about the world is equally valuable: Lucy doesn't know the shoe size of every person in the story, because for some reason it is only her own shoe size that matters. On the other hand, the Table of All Known Facts can store different kinds of information, whereas the revolutions table has no way of storing shoe sizes or sunset times. And <span class="boldface">Murder on the Orient Express</span> works differently again, because it is storing knowledge that concerns people and things that already exist in the world model, rather than abstract ideas. Our way of modeling character knowledge, in other words, will depend quite a lot on what kind of knowledge it is.</p>
<p>The possibilities of character reasoning are similarly broad, but <span class="boldface">The Problem of Edith</span> introduces one kind: the character has a concept of how different conversation topics relate to one another, so that when she is asked about a new keyword, she picks a response that makes the question most relevant to the conversation already in progress.</p>
<p>We end with a longer scenario, in which we track what the character knows about the player and the conversational state: in <span class="boldface">Chronic Hinting Syndrome</span>, the main character guides conversation in the direction he intends it to go, with the player's sometimes-reluctant participation.</p>
