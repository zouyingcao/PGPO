<p>Not all characters are friendly, and there are times when we may want to include a fight sequence. There are a number of ways to approach this, depending on whether we want to offer the player a random outcome, a predetermined one, or a combat sequence that depends partly on strategy or on having the proper equipment.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Lanista 1</span> demonstrates randomized combat in the style of a role-playing game. The player has a partially random chance of doing any given amount of damage; both the player and his opponent have hit points, and whichever one runs out first dies. <span class="boldface">Lanista 2</span> continues this idea, but includes weapons that affect the amount of of damage done. <span class="boldface">Red Cross</span> by itself implements a command that we might use to find out how strong characters are at the moment.</p>
<p>A word of warning about designing such sequences: a player who gets a roll he doesn't like always has the option of UNDOing a turn and re-rolling. This means that he can always win a random battle sooner or later; bad luck only means that it takes him longer (so he gets more bored and irritated as he plays through). It is possible to turn off UNDO implementation with</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23697" -->
<a id="c23697"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Use UNDO prevention.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...but there is a good chance that this will irritate players in itself. Role-playing-style combat scenarios need careful design, lest they actively make a story less fun.</p>
<p>In a slightly more realistic setting, combat leaves physical remains behind, unless we're wielding some kind of futuristic weapon that evaporates our opponents entirely: <span class="boldface">Puff of Orange Smoke</span> demonstrates characters who leave corpses behind when they die, while <span class="boldface">Technological Terror</span> more tamely explodes robots into numerous component parts.</p>
<p>Finally, we can imagine some scenarios in which, instead of allowing characters to strike at each other for random damage, we want to introduce an element of strategy. <span class="boldface">Don Pedro's Revenge</span> shows the rudiments of a system in which the characters can make different kinds of attack depending on where they are in a room filled with perches, barrels, and other swashbuckler props.</p>

<p>Back in the chapter on randomization, we explored a way to create a randomized combat system. That system didn't allow for multiple weapons, though. Here we explore how to create an ATTACK IT WITH action that will let the player choose between weapons with different maximum powers.</p>
<p>We're also going to rewrite that original &quot;instead of attacking:&quot; rule into an attacking it with action that can be performed equally by the player or by any of the player's enemies.</p>

<p>Here's why: If we leave the default attack command in place, Inform will continue to accept commands like &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR, but reply foolishly with the default &quot;Violence is not the answer...&quot; response.</p>
<p>A somewhat better approach would be to change the reply of &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR to say something like &quot;You must specify a weapon to attack with.&quot; But this is still less than ideal, because it means that the player has to then rewrite his entire command. If, on the other hand, we take out &quot;ATTACK GLADIATOR&quot; entirely, the game will always prompt &quot;What do you want to attack the gladiator with?&quot; -- which teaches the player the correct command structure for this particular game, and avoids pretending to understand any command that is not meaningful within this game.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of work because ATTACK has a lot of synonyms in the default library, but if we look through the actions index we can find them all:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31357" -->
<a id="c31357"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;thump&quot; and &quot;break&quot; and &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;wreck&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we make our new command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31358" -->
<a id="c31358"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Attacking it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing. Understand &quot;attack [someone] with [something preferably held]&quot; as attacking it with.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that we've specified &quot;one carried thing&quot;, because we want the player to pick up a weapon to use if necessary. And now we assign all the old attack vocabulary to apply to the new command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31359" -->
<a id="c31359"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;thump&quot; and &quot;break&quot; and &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;wreck&quot; as &quot;attack&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but order of source code matters here: we first get rid of the old, default vocabulary, then define our new action, then make the vocabulary apply to that new action. Inform will now understand &gt;HIT GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, &gt;BREAK GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, and so on.</p>
<p>Our new action is also a perfect place to use an action variable: we're going to need to choose an amount of damage done and refer to that several times in our action rules. So let's set that up first:</p>

Section 4 - Attacking it with
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>In our new system, we want to specify what is being used for an attack. This means that we need to create a new &quot;attacking it with&quot; action, and also that we should disable the existing &quot;attacking...&quot; command.</p>
<p>Here's why: If we leave the default attack command in place, Inform will continue to accept commands like &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR, but reply foolishly with the default &quot;Violence is not the answer...&quot; response.</p>
<p>A somewhat better approach would be to change the reply of &gt;ATTACK GLADIATOR to say something like &quot;You must specify a weapon to attack with.&quot; But this is still less than ideal, because it means that the player has to then rewrite his entire command. If, on the other hand, we take out &quot;ATTACK GLADIATOR&quot; entirely, the game will always prompt &quot;What do you want to attack the gladiator with?&quot; -- which teaches the player the correct command structure for this particular game, and avoids pretending to understand any command that is not meaningful within this game.</p>
<p>This is a little bit of work because ATTACK has a lot of synonyms in the default library, but if we look through the actions index we can find them all:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31389" -->
<a id="c31389"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;attack&quot; and &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;thump&quot; and &quot;break&quot; and &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;wreck&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Now we make our new command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31390" -->
<a id="c31390"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Attacking it with is an action applying to one visible thing and one carried thing. Understand &quot;attack [someone] with [something preferably held]&quot; as attacking it with.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Note that we've specified &quot;one carried thing&quot;, because we want the player to pick up a weapon to use if necessary. And now we assign all the old attack vocabulary to apply to the new command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31391" -->
<a id="c31391"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the commands &quot;punch&quot; and &quot;destroy&quot; and &quot;kill&quot; and &quot;murder&quot; and &quot;hit&quot; and &quot;thump&quot; and &quot;break&quot; and &quot;smash&quot; and &quot;torture&quot; and &quot;wreck&quot; as &quot;attack&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but order of source code matters here: we first get rid of the old, default vocabulary, then define our new action, then make the vocabulary apply to that new action. Inform will now understand &gt;HIT GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, &gt;BREAK GLADIATOR WITH TRIDENT, and so on.</p>
<p>Our new action is also a perfect place to use an action variable: we're going to need to choose an amount of damage done and refer to that several times in our action rules. So let's set that up first:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c31392" -->

<p>Those devoted to role-playing will note that our form of randomization is still pretty naive: most RPG systems use multiple dice in order to create more interesting probability curves. For a system that simulates actual dice-rolling, see the full &quot;Reliques of Tolti-Aph&quot; game.</p>
