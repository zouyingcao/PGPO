<p class="sectionheading">ยง5.3. Characterization</p>
<p>Much of the personality of the player character in IF emerges from what he can and cannot (or will and will not) do; part of the pleasure of playing a character arises from this opportunity for role-playing and role-exploration. Some characters are consciousless daredevils, willing to jump off cliffs, crawl through narrow gaps, and rob widows if the player commands it; others are repressed neurotics who barely dare to speak to other characters or touch anything that doesn't belong to them.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Finishing School</span> and <span class="boldface">Dearth and the Maiden</span> both treat the case of a character constrained by good manners and a sense of polite society: the former forbids only one action, while the latter condemns a whole range of them.</p>
<p>Constraining the character is only the half of it: we might also want to think about what sorts of unusual actions that character might be especially likely to take, and account for these. Of course, major actions that affect the story world will require some thought and implementation work, and we should consider carefully before making the player a character like, say, the Noble of Glamour, a spirit in human form who can charm all comers, transform bespectacled secretaries into divas, and cause spontaneous cloudbursts of scarlet glitter.</p>
<p>But even simple humans have some characteristic traits and gestures. We will probably want to write some characteristic reaction to EXAMINE ME, as demonstrated in <span class="boldface">Bad Hair Day</span>. We might provide a few pieces of clothing or props that aren't strictly critical in the story, like a policeman's helmet or a feather boa:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23616" -->
<a id="c23616"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The player is wearing a policeman's helmet.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>We can liven up the interactive aspect of characterization if we give the player a little scope for role-playing: this may mean responding to gestures, like</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23617" -->
<a id="c23617"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;bite nails&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Your only nail remaining is the one on your left thumb, and you're saving it for the AP Calculus exam.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(Of course, we would need to have hinted to the player that nail-biting is characteristic of his character.)</p>
