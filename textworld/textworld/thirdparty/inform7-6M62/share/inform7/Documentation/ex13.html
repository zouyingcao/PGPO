<p>Inform has altogether five mutually exclusive ways in which one thing can be physically joined to another one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c941" -->
<a id="c941"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
containment relation - The coin is in the purse.
<br />support relation - The coin is on the table.
<br />incorporation relation - The coin is part of the sculpture.
<br />carrying relation - The coin is carried by Peter.
<br />wearing relation - The jacket is worn by Peter.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This is why we cannot have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c942" -->
<a id="c942"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<br />The coin is part of the table.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>simultaneously, and it is a rare exception to the general rule that having one relation does not affect having another.</p>
<p>But there is also a sixth relation used in Inform for these meanings: the possession relation, which is the meaning of the verb &quot;to have&quot;. At first sight this looks the same as the carrying relation, but in fact it is a convenient shorthand for &quot;carrying or wearing&quot;, provided for conditions rather than assertions:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c943" -->
<a id="c943"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if Mr Darcy has a wet shirt ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will be true during play if he is either carrying or wearing the shirt.</p>
<p>Still another relation exists which can be tested, but not declared to be true or false: the concealment relation, which is the meaning of the verb &quot;to conceal&quot;. So we can ask:</p>
