<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.3. Overriding existing commands</p>
<p>Suppose we are devising specialist commands for a game of whist, and we want &quot;discard&quot; as one of them. Looking at the table of commands in the Action index, we find that, inconveniently enough, &quot;discard&quot; already has a meaning: it is synonymous with &quot;drop&quot;, and while that might be sensible most of the time, it is perfectly wrong now. We need a way to free up &quot;discard&quot; for our own use. We can do that by:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1325" -->
<a id="c1325"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the command &quot;discard&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This cuts it loose, so to speak, and ready to be given new meanings. If we check the Actions index again, we find no mention of &quot;discard&quot; - it is now a blank slate - but &quot;drop&quot; is still exactly as it was. We could now say something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1326" -->
<a id="c1326"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;discard [something]&quot; as discarding.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(If we had declared that &quot;drop&quot; was something new, the whole thing would have happened in reverse, with &quot;discard&quot; retaining all of the original grammar. Inform does not distinguish between a command and its synonym.)</p>
<p>The &quot;... as something new&quot; sentence works even for a command which did not exist anyway, for instance with:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1327" -->
<a id="c1327"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand the command &quot;zylqix&quot; as something new.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Of course this does nothing - but it is intentional that it generates no problem messages: it means that the sentence can be used to force a command to be fresh and untouched by previous definitions, which might be useful when working with extensions by other people.</p>
<p>It is also possible to clear out all the commands leading to a given action:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1328" -->
<a id="c1328"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand nothing as taking.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The commands &quot;take&quot; and &quot;get&quot; will still exist, but now they'll only have their other senses (for taking off clothes, for getting out of boxes).</p>
