<p>What does &quot;in&quot; mean? It's worth just a brief diversion to cover this, because &quot;in&quot; has two subtly different meanings.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Meaning 1.</span> Usually, if X is &quot;in&quot; Y then this is because of containment. A croquet ball is &quot;in&quot; a croquet box, which is &quot;in&quot; the Summerhouse. This is the standard meaning, and is the one which happens if we write something like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c424" -->
<a id="c424"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The croquet ball is in the box.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>or if we ask a question like:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c425" -->
<a id="c425"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This kind of &quot;in&quot; talks only about direct containment. If we ask</p>
<!-- START CODE "c426" -->
<a id="c426"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet ball is in the Summerhouse, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>then the answer is that it isn't - it is in the box which is itself in the Summerhouse, but that's not the same thing.</p>
<p>This is almost always the meaning of &quot;in&quot; that we intend. This is only one of a number of relationships between objects - there are also &quot;part of&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, &quot;worn by&quot; and &quot;carried by&quot;, for example. If we have</p>
<!-- START CODE "c427" -->
<a id="c427"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The bird feed is on the sundial.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>...then &quot;if the bird feed is in the sundial&quot; won't be true: the relationship here is one called support (being on top of, in effect), not containment. But there's no confusion because &quot;on&quot; and &quot;in&quot; are different words, so it's no problem that they have different meanings.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Meaning 2.</span> Much less common. If X is &quot;in&quot; Y and Y is a region, then the meaning is slightly different. Suppose the Garden Area is a region, and contains several rooms - the Croquet Lawn, the Terrace and so on. Then</p>
<!-- START CODE "c428" -->
<a id="c428"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the Garden Area, ...
<br />if the bird feed is in the Garden Area, ...
<br />if the Terrace is in the Garden Area, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>are all true. This seems very natural, but in fact is quite different from the first meaning of &quot;in&quot;. It allows rooms (and even other regions) to be &quot;in&quot; a region, and it allows indirect containment.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">How Inform decides.</span> So which meaning does Inform use, and when? Since these two meanings are so different, it clearly matters.</p>
<p>The answer is that meaning 1 is always the meaning of &quot;X is in Y&quot; unless Y is explicitly the name of a region. Thus:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c429" -->
<a id="c429"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the Garden Area, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is meaning 2, because &quot;Garden Area&quot; is the name of a region. That seems fair enough, but values are indeed sometimes given names (becoming &quot;variables&quot;, or values &quot;that vary&quot;). Suppose &quot;mystery value&quot; is a name for a value which is an object, but which has different identities at different times. Then Inform reads</p>
<!-- START CODE "c430" -->
<a id="c430"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is in the mystery value, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>as meaning 1, because whatever &quot;mystery value&quot; is, it isn't explicitly a region name, even if from time to time it might happen to be equal to a region.</p>
<p>That sometimes makes meaning 2 difficult to express. If we ever need it, and this is fairly rare, we can write it like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c431" -->
<a id="c431"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
if the croquet box is regionally in the mystery value, ...
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because &quot;regionally in&quot; is always meaning 2 of &quot;in&quot;.</p>
