<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> Whenever the name of a thing or room is printed.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> For items other than the current player, the &quot;printed name&quot; property is printed out; but for the current player, &quot;you&quot; or &quot;yourself&quot; is printed. (That doesn't necessarily mean that the &quot;printed name&quot; of the player is never used. Suppose there are two people, Alice and Bob, and the narrative switches between them: when Alice is the player, she appears as &quot;yourself&quot; but Bob is &quot;Bob&quot;; but when Bob is the player, he is &quot;yourself&quot; and Alice is &quot;Alice&quot;.)</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) A pen which is described differently in inventories:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1466" -->
<a id="c1466"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Rule for printing the name of the pen while taking inventory: say &quot;useful pen&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>&quot;Taking inventory&quot; is a condition which is true if that's the current action and not otherwise, so the effect is that the pen is called &quot;a useful pen&quot; only in inventory listings. &quot;While looking&quot; is a similarly useful one.</p>
<p>(b) Italicising the names of novels:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1467" -->
<a id="c1467"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
A novel is a kind of thing. Dr Zhivago and Persuasion are novels. Before printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[italic type]&quot;. After printing the name of a novel, say &quot;[roman type]&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(c) Telling the time:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1468" -->
<a id="c1468"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After printing the name of the wrist watch while taking inventory: say &quot; (time: [the time of day])&quot;.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>(d) Merging containers with their contents:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1469" -->
<a id="c1469"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
<a href="javascript:pasteCode('Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]if the bottle contains sand, say [=0x0022=]bottle of sand[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]otherwise say [=0x0022=]empty bottle[=0x0022=];[=0x000A=][=0x0009=]omit contents in listing.[=0x000A=][=0x000A=]\n')"><img alt="paste.png" src="Documentation/Images/paste.png" /></a> Rule for printing the name of the bottle while not inserting or removing:

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;otherwise say &quot;empty bottle&quot;;
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;omit contents in listing.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This example makes use of a special phrase:</p>
<!-- START PHRASE "defn258" -->
<div class="definition"><a id="defn258"></a><p class="defnprototype"><b>omit contents in listing</b></p>
<!-- END PHRASE -->
<!-- definition of ph_omit -->

<p>This phrase changes the form of an inventory listing, room description, etc., so that it will simply list &quot;a bottle of sand&quot; or &quot;an empty bottle&quot;, rather than &quot;a bottle (in which is sand)&quot; or &quot;a bottle (which is empty)&quot;. It should be used only when the listing is imminent, and does not have permanent effect.</p>

<!-- end definition -->
</div>

<p>The clause about not inserting or removing is to prevent messages like &quot;You put the sand in the bottle of sand.&quot;, where it's confusing to refer to the bottle as anything other than &quot;the bottle&quot;.</p>

The Doctor's Cabin is a room. &quot;A dark, cramped triangle, like a slice of cake, except that its sharp end has been cut off: and so low that a moderately tall man would strike his head on the deck above if he were to stand upright. Every free surface is covered with sheets of best Venetian looking-glass, to increase the light filtering in. Long use and the carpenter's ingenuity have packed in a folding cot and table, and lockers are built into unlikely places: lockers filled with specimens, skeletons, sketches, drafts and serial letters.&quot; The jug is a bottle in the Doctor's Cabin.
