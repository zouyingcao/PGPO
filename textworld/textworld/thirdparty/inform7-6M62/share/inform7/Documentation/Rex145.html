<p class="sectionheading">ยง6.4. Looking</p>
<p>Looking is quite a complicated command, since the production of a room description takes many steps. A detailed description of this process may be found in the Room Descriptions section.</p>
<p>By convention, a player sees full descriptions of rooms he enters more than once, but may type BRIEF in order to see shorter descriptions, and SUPERBRIEF tells the story never to print room descriptions at all. VERBOSE restores the default behavior.</p>
<p>These conventions are not always appropriate, however, especially in works where experiencing a changing environment is essential. The use option</p>

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>changes the default behavior so that rooms are not always described fully to the player. <span class="boldface">Verbosity</span> demonstrates how this works.</p>
<p>The player always has the option of turning room descriptions to BRIEF or SUPERBRIEF mode. <span class="boldface">Verbosity 2</span> demonstrates how we might remove the player's ability to change the default behavior.</p>

<p>Suppose that we want the player always to see full room descriptions, even if he tries to reset the defaults -- perhaps because there is vital information there which he will miss if he turns off full-length room descriptions.</p>
<p>To do this, we might want to remove the standard behavior of the three actions associated with BRIEF, SUPERBRIEF, and VERBOSE, replacing them with explanatory messages about how the game behaves.
