<p class="sectionheading">ยง17.21. Understanding mistakes</p>
<p>When inspiration strikes the player, he can usually be relied upon to make a good-faith effort to communicate the new idea: he will guess the right command. If he guesses wrongly, the mistake is probably the author's, because a good author will try to anticipate all possible wordings and make all of them work.</p>
<p>Nevertheless it is sometimes good practice to nudge the player towards the right wording - particularly if the player has the right idea but is not explicit enough: for instance, typing TALK TO JUDGE when we really want to know what is to be said (JUDGE, GUILTY); or if the player tries something like PLAY CHESS rather than MOVE PAWN TO KING 4. Similarly, if we make a casual reference such as &quot;In your childhood days, you loved sliding in stocking feet across this hallway&quot;, a player might type SLIDE IN STOCKING FEET: a nice idea, and which deserves a nice response, even though it asks to do something beyond the scope of the story.</p>
<p>Inform provides a simple mechanism for recognising a command but at the same time recognising that <span class="italic">it does not properly specify an action</span>. Such commands are called &quot;mistakes&quot;, for the sake of a memorable term, but the player has not really behaved badly, and should be helped rather than reproved. For instance:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1414" -->
<a id="c1414"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>While that works - the command to &quot;act&quot; is indeed rejected - it is not very good, because no very helpful message is brought up. The following is much better:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1415" -->
<a id="c1415"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or we could once again insist on a given context:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1416" -->
<a id="c1416"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>That still has the drawback that the command &quot;act hamlet&quot; will not be recognised: so the final version we want is probably</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1417" -->
<a id="c1417"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;act [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;To join the actors, you have to adopt a role in the play! Try PLAY HAMLET or similar.&quot;) when the location is the Garden Theatre.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>since the &quot;[text]&quot; part will soak up any words the player types (or none), meaning that any command at all whose first word is &quot;act&quot; will be matched.</p>
<p>We need to be careful to avoid circular things like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1418" -->
<a id="c1418"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;[text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;'[the topic understood]' is something I really wish you wouldn't say.&quot;) when the topic understood is a topic listed in table 1.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This doesn't work because the topic understood isn't set until the line has been understood, but Inform checks the &quot;when...&quot; condition before it tries to understand the line. Indeed, even this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1419" -->
<a id="c1419"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;[text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;'[the topic understood]' is something I really wish you wouldn't say.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>is unsafe (quite apart from being unwise!) - again, &quot;topic understood&quot; doesn't exist for a mistake, because in a mistake, nothing is understood.</p>
<p>The following is often useful during beta-testing of a new work, though we would not want it in the final published edition. Many authors like to ask their testers not to try anything in particular, simply to play naturally: but to record the transcript of the session, and email it back to the author. The following command is a device to allow the tester to type a comment in to the transcript:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1420" -->
<a id="c1420"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;* [text]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Noted.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>For instance, the tester might type &quot;* DIDN'T WE SAY DARCY WAS TALL?&quot;, to which the story would reply &quot;Noted.&quot; - and the author can search for such comments when receiving the transcript.</p>
<p>If we are careful, we can make the reply depend on what was typed in the mistaken command:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c1421" -->
<a id="c1421"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Understand &quot;steal [something]&quot; as a mistake (&quot;Just TAKE [the noun] and leave without paying: that's stealing in my book.&quot;).
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>The care comes in because Inform applies much less checking to mistakes than to other actions, and odd errors will result if we try to refer to (say) &quot;the second noun&quot; in a command which did not have a second noun.</p>
<p>It's probably wise to take particular care if using &quot;as a mistake&quot; with any command which might include the mistake among what the player calls ALL: for example, if &quot;take [sydney harbour bridge]&quot; is understood as a mistake, then TAKE ALL will may result in this, even though the player doesn't intend any such thing.</p>
