<p class="sectionheading">ยง12.3. Giving instructions to other people</p>
<p>So far, all actions have been carried out by the player: which is fine for exploring the passive world of an empty warehouse, but less good for a drama in which other characters have to be contended with. In fact, an action can be carried out by anybody - by any instance of the &quot;person&quot; kind, that is, which includes all the men, women and animals in the story, and not only the player.</p>
<p>In interactive fiction, players conventionally ask other characters to do something with commands like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c839" -->
<a id="c839"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
&gt; will, go west
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Clearly &quot;will, go west&quot; should not produce the same action as &quot;go west&quot;, because a different person will be trying it: this person is called the &quot;actor&quot;, and while the actor is ordinarily the player, here it is the character called Will. Inform distinguishes these two actions like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c840" -->
<a id="c840"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
going west
<br />asking Will to try going west
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>As a result, we can write rules like so:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c841" -->
<a id="c841"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of asking Will to try going west, say &quot;Will scratches his head, baffled by this talk of westward. Is not the ocean without bound?&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>To write rules like this, we sometimes want to generalise about who is supposed to do the deed. To do this we can refer to &quot;person asked&quot;, just as the &quot;noun&quot; stands for whatever noun was typed:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c842" -->
<a id="c842"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Instead of asking somebody to try taking something, say &quot;I don't think we ought to tempt [the person asked] into theft, surely?&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>So if the player types &quot;Algy, take sandwich&quot;, the &quot;person asked&quot; would be Algy; the &quot;noun&quot; would be the sandwich; and there would be no &quot;second noun&quot;.</p>

<p>It simplifies matters that our map of Greece makes it possible to reach any location from any other location, by some sequence of movements: if there were an isolated location -- say, Crete -- with no map connection to the mainland, then we would have to worry about the &quot;right direction&quot; not being a direction at all. The following version of Hermes' trekking rule is protected against the possibility:</p>
