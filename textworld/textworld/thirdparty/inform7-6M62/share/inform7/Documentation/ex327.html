<p>This fudges slightly, since an odd-length string will be divided into uneven halves. Keeping track of fractional inches would complicate matters, though, so let's assume for now that this doesn't matter.</p>

The string repository contains 35 strings.

<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Since our initial string is 36 inches long and it is impossible for the player to divide it into pieces smaller than an inch each, we need a total of 36 items to represent all the string-bits: one that the player carries at the outset, and 35 others. We should bear in mind that it is usually a good idea to use the smallest number of spare objects we can get away with: writing a game that required 1000 strings in the string repository would place silly demands on the resources of the system, so it's best to avoid that sort of thing if possible.</p>
<p>Now with a bit of fiddling we can also teach Inform to recognize descriptors such as &quot;the shortest string&quot;:</p>

<p>This is still a little incomplete because we cannot refer to strings by their lengths, as in &quot;the 2 inch string&quot; and so on. To do this, we borrow a line from the chapter on Understanding:</p>
