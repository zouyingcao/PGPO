<p>Occasionally we would like to change the way the name of something is printed as part of our inventory, and we can do this with a printing the name rule such as</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23679" -->
<a id="c23679"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">

<p>There are also several possibilities for redesigning the inventory list as a whole. <span class="boldface">Persephone</span> shows how to divide an inventory list into two parts, a &quot;You are carrying: &quot; section and a &quot;You are wearing: &quot; section. <span class="boldface">Equipment List</span> goes further, and shows how we might use Inform's specialized listing functions to create a variety of differently formatted inventories.</p>
<p>Sometimes the way Inform by default lists properties such as &quot;(closed)&quot; or &quot;(open but empty)&quot; isn't quite what we want. <span class="boldface">Oyster Wide Shut</span> offers a flexible alternative to the standard behavior, allowing finer control over which properties are listed and how they are described.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">Trying Taking Manhattan</span> replaces the inventory behavior for other characters: instead of silently looking through their possessions (but not describing them to the player), they now describe to the player what they're carrying and wearing.</p>

<p>Most of the phrase options above are relatively self-explanatory; a few are less so. Here is an overview:</p>
<p>&quot;With newlines&quot; tells Inform to put a new line before each listed object. Indented tells it to indent contents of objects, when listing these.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving inventory information&quot; means to append information such as (closed) or (being worn) to objects.</p>
<p>&quot;As a sentence&quot; means to put &quot;and&quot; before the last object and commas between them; this is usually not used in conjunction with newline listing. &quot;As a sentence&quot; obeys whatever conventions about the use of the serial comma we may have established with the &quot;Use serial comma&quot; option.</p>
<p>&quot;Including contents&quot; means to list the contents of open or transparent containers and all supporters, whereas including all contents means to list the contents of all containers, even opaque closed ones.</p>
<p>&quot;Tersely&quot;, perhaps unexpectedly, puts parentheses around objects listed as the contents of other objects.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving brief inventory information&quot; omits most of the inventory tags, such as &quot;(open)&quot; and &quot;(worn)&quot;, but does list &quot;(closed)&quot; for closed containers which might not otherwise be obviously openable.</p>
<p>&quot;Using the definite article&quot; means prefixing objects with &quot;the&quot;, if applicable, rather than &quot;a&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Listing marked items only&quot; means including only objects that have already been declared &quot;marked for listing&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Prefacing with is-are&quot; means that Inform will write &quot;is&quot; before the list if it contains only one item, and &quot;are&quot; if the list contains more than one.</p>
<p>&quot;Not listing concealed items&quot; means to omit from the list anything which is scenery.</p>
<p>Finally, &quot;with extra indentation&quot; means that the whole list should be indented slightly, in emulation of the default inventory listing.</p>
<p>With this information, we can try rewriting the inventory behavior to emulate the standard or to explore alternate versions:</p>

<div class="egpanel" id="example103">
<p>Most of the phrase options above are relatively self-explanatory; a few are less so. Here is an overview:</p>
<p>&quot;With newlines&quot; tells Inform to put a new line before each listed object. Indented tells it to indent contents of objects, when listing these.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving inventory information&quot; means to append information such as (closed) or (being worn) to objects.</p>
<p>&quot;As a sentence&quot; means to put &quot;and&quot; before the last object and commas between them; this is usually not used in conjunction with newline listing. &quot;As a sentence&quot; obeys whatever conventions about the use of the serial comma we may have established with the &quot;Use serial comma&quot; option.</p>
<p>&quot;Including contents&quot; means to list the contents of open or transparent containers and all supporters, whereas including all contents means to list the contents of all containers, even opaque closed ones.</p>
<p>&quot;Tersely&quot;, perhaps unexpectedly, puts parentheses around objects listed as the contents of other objects.</p>
<p>&quot;Giving brief inventory information&quot; omits most of the inventory tags, such as &quot;(open)&quot; and &quot;(worn)&quot;, but does list &quot;(closed)&quot; for closed containers which might not otherwise be obviously openable.</p>
<p>&quot;Using the definite article&quot; means prefixing objects with &quot;the&quot;, if applicable, rather than &quot;a&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Listing marked items only&quot; means including only objects that have already been declared &quot;marked for listing&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Prefacing with is-are&quot; means that Inform will write &quot;is&quot; before the list if it contains only one item, and &quot;are&quot; if the list contains more than one.</p>
<p>&quot;Not listing concealed items&quot; means to omit from the list anything which is scenery.</p>
<p>Finally, &quot;with extra indentation&quot; means that the whole list should be indented slightly, in emulation of the default inventory listing.</p>
<p>With this information, we can try rewriting the inventory behavior to emulate the standard or to explore alternate versions:</p>
