<p class="sectionheading">ยง9.5. Dice and Playing Cards</p>
<p>Most toys are single things, and no harder to create than any other small items, but games often require a multitude of tokens to be combined, and this can be logistically tricky.</p>
<p>The classic example is a pack of playing cards, where the player must individually control 52 items but without fussy commands or verbose text being printed back. <span class="boldface">Jokers Wild</span> provides a simple &quot;one card at a time&quot; approach; <span class="boldface">Tilt 1</span> is more sophisticated, with 52 independently accessible cards; <span class="boldface">Tilt 2</span> can further judge the value of a selection of cards - the ranking of a poker hand.</p>
<p>Drawing cards from a shuffled pack is only one source of randomness. Games of chance also involve items drawn from a bag: <span class="boldface">Wonka's Revenge</span> provides just such a lottery. More often, dice are thrown. A single die is easy enough:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c23727" -->
<a id="c23727"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The die is carried by the player. After dropping the die: say &quot;It lands with [a random number from 1 to 6] uppermost.&quot; Understand &quot;roll [something]&quot; as dropping.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Quick, but not very good. Most dice games involve rolling more than one die at a time, to get a more interesting distribution of outcomes: they may also involve special rules applying to doubles, for instance. See <span class="boldface">Do Pass Go</span>.</p>

<p>We've simulated a deck of cards before, but only as entries in a table. This time we're going to do it more completely, with card objects that can be drawn and discarded, and referred to by name. The tedious way to do this would be to make 52 objects by hand and laboriously write out their names and understand rules.</p>
<p>A more sensible way is to make 52 identical card objects, assign them ranks and suits, and allow Inform to generate and parse their names automatically.</p>

<p>This is enough already to let inform understand things like &quot;ten clubs&quot;, but we want to add a couple of refinements. For one thing, we'd like to accept &quot;of&quot; when it appears in phrases such as &quot;ten of clubs&quot; (but not generically otherwise); for another, we'd like the player to be able to use various names for ranks. To this end, we need to borrow from the Activities chapter and modify the player's command before attempting to understand it:</p>

<p>This is enough already to let inform understand things like &quot;ten clubs&quot;, but we want to add a couple of refinements. For one thing, we'd like to accept &quot;of&quot; when it appears in phrases such as &quot;ten of clubs&quot; (but not generically otherwise); for another, we'd like the player to be able to use various names for ranks. To this end, we need to borrow from the Activities chapter and modify the player's command before attempting to understand it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c29735" -->
<a id="c29735"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
After reading a command:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;if the player's command includes &quot;of [suit]&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while the player's command includes &quot;of&quot;:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;cut the matched text;

<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while the player's command includes topic entry:
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;replace the matched text with value entry.
<br />&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;[This allows Inform to understand &quot;ace&quot;, &quot;deuce&quot;, &quot;king&quot;, etc., as numerical ranks.]
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>It may be a bit confusing that the Table of Value Names has both a topic column and a term column, to all appearances essentially identical. But items in the topic column can be matched against the player's input, whereas items in other kinds of text column can be printed out; the two kinds of text are not treated identically by Inform, so we need to have both. Notice that the topic column contains entries like &quot;jack/knave,&quot; which will match either &quot;jack&quot; or &quot;knave&quot; in the player's input.</p>
<p>Now to set up the deck at the outset. With some intelligent looping, we avoid having to declare every combination of suit and number individually:</p>
