<p><span class="boldface">1. When it happens.</span> See &quot;printing the locale description&quot;. This activity is expected to decide which items ought to be mentioned in a locale description for a given room, enterable container or enterable supporter, and to give each item a priority, which is a number ranging upwards from 1 (which is the top priority). The lower the priority number, the earlier the mention, or at least, the earlier the opportunity to be mentioned: it's up to other activities whether to give it a paragraph of its own or not. This activity only makes something a candidate, and decides what order the candidates will be tried in.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">2. The default behaviour.</span> By default, this activity contains only the &quot;standard notable locale objects rule&quot;. This chooses exactly those items directly contained by the locale, assigning all of them priority 5. Note that this includes scenery, and other probably unwanted items - those will be excluded later.</p>
<p><span class="boldface">3. Examples.</span> (a) In the Misty Moorlands, only large items on the ground are visible through the mist:</p>

<p>It's best to avoid situations where an item has a locale priority which is higher than that of something it is on top of, or inside, since this can result in an oddly-worded description.</p>

<p>In a work of interactive fiction that involves many new discoveries, we might want to change the way we narrate room descriptions and describe objects as the player learns new information.</p>
<p>One approach to this is to create a model of the facts we want the player to find out, and attach some narrative text to each. When a fact becomes relevant to the story, that narrative text is shown to the player. So:</p>

<p>Now, we also need a way to tell Inform to introduce certain new facts when the right previous ones have been introduced. We'll create a &quot;following&quot; relation, according to which a new fact can be told to the player when the player has already learned all the facts it follows. This way, we can simulate the effect of putting together several pieces of evidence to come to a conclusion:</p>

<p>Next we need a way for the game to introduce these new facts. Let's say we want them to come up when the player examines something appropriate, or sees it in the room:</p>

<p>The &quot;after choosing notable locale objects&quot; line here handles things so that any interesting conclusions we want to draw are always given first, followed by the less interesting description.</p>
