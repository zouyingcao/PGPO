<p class="sectionheading">ยง4.12. Values that vary</p>
<p>Sometimes a value important to the simulated world will not naturally belong to any thing or room, and should not be kept in a property. In fact, we have seen a value that varies already: &quot;location&quot;, which holds the room in which the story is presently taking place. Here's how we might make a new one:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c249" -->
<a id="c249"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The prevailing wind is a direction that varies. The prevailing wind is southwest.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>Or &quot;which varies&quot; would also be allowed, as would the more traditional computing term &quot;variable&quot;:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c250" -->
<a id="c250"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The prevailing wind is a direction variable. The prevailing wind is southwest.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>A briefer way to do this is to use the word &quot;initially&quot;, which alerts Inform to the possibility that the value will change in future:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c251" -->
<a id="c251"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The prevailing wind is initially southwest.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>This creates the variable and gives it an initial value all in one sentence.</p>
<p>It's not compulsory to give an initial value. If we do not, Inform will use the default value for its kind. (See the table in the Kinds index.) For example, writing just</p>
<!-- START CODE "c252" -->
<a id="c252"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The grand tally is a number that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>will start it at the value 0, because that's the default value for numbers.</p>
<p>We can have variables of any of the kinds of value, including new ones, but should watch out for a potential error. If we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c253" -->
<a id="c253"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The receptacle is a container that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>in a world which has no containers at all, Inform will object, because it will be unable to put any initial value into the receptacle variable. A similar complaint will be made if we write:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c254" -->
<a id="c254"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Colour is a kind of value. The fashionable shade is a colour that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>without ever having defined any colours. Something else we are not permitted is:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c255" -->
<a id="c255"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
The receptacle is an open container that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>because the openness of a given container may change during play, so that the value in the variable might suddenly become invalid even though the variable itself had not changed.</p>
<p>As a final note on kinds, when Inform reads something like this:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c256" -->
<a id="c256"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Peter is a man. The accursed one is initially Peter.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>it has to make a decision about the kind of &quot;accursed one&quot;. Peter is a &quot;man&quot;, so that seems like the right answer, but Inform wants to play safe in case the variable later needs to change to a woman called Jane, say, or even a black hat. So Inform in fact creates &quot;accursed one&quot; as an object that varies, not a man that varies, to give us the maximum freedom to use it. If we don't want that then we can override it:</p>
<!-- START CODE "c257" -->
<a id="c257"></a><blockquote class="code"><p class="quoted">
Peter is a man. The accursed one is initially Peter.
<br />The accursed one is a man that varies.
</p></blockquote>
<!-- END CODE -->
<p>thus telling Inform exactly what is intended.</p>
