3K56 (4 May 2006)

(Mac OS X only) Support for OS 10.3.9 restored.
(Mac OS X only) Build number now correct in Finder's Information window
	for the application file.
Changed the "tieing" action to "tying". (Inform's British author thought
	this was an American spelling, and vice versa. Sorry.) This entailed
	changes to examples Otranto, Brown, Snip, Snip Snip, and Under Contract.
Bug in U-Stor-It example fixed, and Disappointment Bay 12 slightly improved.
Tidied up documentation of Basic Screen Effects and Plurality extensions.
Fixed the "South is a dead end with printed name "Collapsed Dead End"."
	bug causing the Undertomb example in the main text to fail to compile.
Fixed problem with the "Early Childhood 4" example.
Fixed compiler hang to do with misunderstood sentences setting the kind
	of a kind to itself.
Fixed internal error on "now X is P", where X is a thing and P an
	property which isn't an either/or property.
Fixed problems with defining a kind which includes the word "object".
Fixed internal error on sentences using "to have" incorrectly.
Fixed internal error on assertions giving inexplicit information about
	the kinds of things (asserting kind(f(x)) = y where f(x) is unknown).
Fixed failure to object to malformed sentences caused by misunderstanding
	of the punctuation convention about quoted text ending sentences.
Fixed failure to object to names of things or rooms containing literal
	double-quoted text (which then failed to compile through I6).
Fixed failure to object to negative assertions in the form "The P is not
	X.", where P is a property taking a value.
